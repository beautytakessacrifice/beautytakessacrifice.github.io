<p>High heeled thongs in winter</p>

<p>I live in the southwest, and although winter time can get cold here, there's never much snow, so you really can wear sandals here all year round if you don't mind the cold. I wear denim skirts (knee length or higher) in the winter with high heel leather thongs on my bare feet. Not the real spiky ones - those are too hard to walk in, but a little bit lower heel with thin, comfortable leather straps. Actually, once the soles of my bare feet warm up the leather of the sandals, they're really not too bad. And I work in an office that has heated floors and carpet, so it's comfortable to go barefooted during the day. Our office is casual, and bare feet are o.k. as long as you're not meeting with clients. Then you just slip your shoes back on. I've gotten a couple of the guys I work with to rub and warm my feet for me when we go out to lunch and stuff, and a girl friend in the office who likes to wear clogs barefooted during the winter, and we pull each other's shoes off during meetings under the table and play footsies all the time. We also hide each others shoes occasionally. Several times in the summer I end up going home barefoot, because she's hidden my thongs and I can't find them before I have to leave.</p>

<p>Yeah, so far the winter has been really mild, with very little snow or rain, but it has been getting a little cold. I'm still skirting it around and wearing my sandals, although the winter is so dry I have to soak my feet every night to keep them soft. The other day one of the guys in our office was wearing clogs in bare feet, and my girlfriend and I were both wearing low and high heeled mules on our bare feet. We were in a meeting sitting on either side of him and we both slipped off our shoes and then used our bare feet to steal the guy's clogs off of his feet. Then we both played footsies with him. (actually we've all three done that before) He has very nice feet for a guy, with nice high arches that are fun to rub with your toes.</p>

<p>Hi I'm Helen and I live in Yorkshire. I travel to work by train and bus so I have to put up with the cold in winter. I used to go bare legged in the summer and put tights on in the winter but it got later and later putting my tights on. About 5 years ago I gave up wearing tights altogether. I hate trousers and being bare legged I was not comfortable in high heeled shoes, so had to wear high heeled strappy sandals. I wear these all year round unless its several feet thick of snow. Last winter we had a lot of very cold days in Yorkshire and my feet often went red with the cold. The coldest they ever got was one day at the beginning of February this year. I waited with a female friend who also travelshome to York from Leeds. We waited half an hour at a bus stop only to find the buses had stopped running because of the snow. We struggled for 3/4 hour through the snow to the train station. My friend did not know how I made it. She by her own admission was wearing thermal underwear a fully lined long wool skirt, blose and thick wooly jumper, thick wool tights and sheepskin lined boots, a long wool caot, hat, scarf and gloves and said she was cold and I made her worse. I on the other hand was wearing only  a very short denim skirt, a denim top with nothing underneath it, a thong and a pair of high heeled strappy sandals. I admit by the time we got to the railway station I was very, very cold. The next day I wore a longer skirt, a camisole top with a jacket but I still braved it in bare legs and strappy sandals and it was still snowing heavily. I love wearing strappy sandals and bare legs. Glad to see some of you do too.</p>

<p>Hi its Helen. I am always barelegged and the most I wear on my feet are strappy sandals so no one finds it unusual and takes photo's of my feet. I am tall and slim (English size 10). I have very long shapely legs that I like to show off, so I often wear very short skirts, some as short as 8" or 9" long. My friends are amazed that I can been warm enough in winter with so much bare leg on show. Its been a fairly mild summer but recently it has turned cold.
I recently went out to the theatre with a group of female friends and the fashion ranged from very wrapped up to very little. Debbie wore a short wool coat with a jumper, a long wool skirt, thick tights and knee length boots. Some of the other girls wore mini skirts with opaque tights and high heeled shoes. Nikkie had a short skirt with footless tights and high heeled sandals. I wore a short strappy top that  due to my hight showed alot of bare midrif, a fairly long almost see through Indian print cotton skirt. When the girls came to collect me I was trying on flip flops but non matched, so as it was not frosty I went barefoot (much to Debbie's horror) When we came out of the theatre we walked to get a meal. The frost had come down and the ground was white. By the time I got home my feet were red and sore with the cold. I was absolutly freezing. I know why I usually wear sandals now. 
Are there any other girls out there that go barefoot in winter? Does anyone wear tights with sandals?

<p>Hi, I have never really thought about it till now, but I suppose it is true for me and my friends. We always wear skimpy clothes when we go out together, and each girl somehow tries to beat the others concerning fashion, which means most of the time wearing less. I admit that sometimes I choose a short top instead of a shirt, prefer bare legs/mini skirt to jeans or refuse to take a jacket just to show off in front of the others. I never wear any tights, socks or whatsoever and am getting into going barefoot even if it is freezing, it is just so cool to show off your naked feet  :-o Bare feet and legs go together so well and naturally. I guess my friends took on that kind of competition as they tend to wear not much as well. And yes, I think I would amend my clothing if some of my friends was getting more attention for being scantier clad than me. Well, I do really freeze on such occasions, but I don't mind, I think I got adjusted to the cold. Sometimes, I even love that goosebumpy shivery feeling! I guess I am immune enough to the cold that I do not get sick too often, but even then, I don't mind, because I love to look fashionable and sexy ;-)</p>

<p>Helen,
I understand that you do not wear much clothing in the cold either ;-). Your experience going out in just a bare midriff strappy top and thin skirt, bare-feeted on a frosty night is amazing! You must have been the center point of attention. Do you wear any underwear? Stupid question, as this does not fit in with your erotic clothing style. I do not wear any either, just no space left under a lowrise jeans/skirt or a tight-fitting top ;-). Will you continue to go out bare-legged or even bare-footed in short miniskirts and just tiny skimpy tops without jacket in cold nasty weather? Will you reveal a lot of skin even if the sub-zero weather makes you freeze your buns off? I guess that's what guys find very sexy about us!

<p>Hi Lissy its Helen. What part of the country do you live in? Yes I will continue to wear strappy sandals and bare legs in this sub zero weather. I do find it too cold barefoot in the heavy frost and cannot go to work barefoot, but otherwise I do go barefoot more and more. As regards undies with very short skirts I wear a thong otherwise I do not wear any underwear.
Its great to know you go barelegged all the time. Have you gone barefoot i this very cold weather? Do you wear backless tops in the cold? What do you wear to work and is it very different to nightime?
Helen.</p>

<p>Hi Helen,
actually I live in northern Germany. I admit that going barefoot in the heavy frost is a challenge, but I might just get used to it.  I try a bit harder every year when the temperatures drop and stretch my barefoot season from autumn into winter.  Certainly I cannot go to work barefoot either and sometimes I really freeze, but I wear strappy sandals and bare legs nevertheless. At work I often wear sleeveless or short-sleeved blouses and skirts. When I attend a meeting or customer appointment, I will slip into a blazer or jacket if the blouse is too revealing. There is not much difference in my clothing whether I go clubbing or shopping or just spend an afternoon on town or stroll through the park. It is different from my working clothes though. The skirts are short or very short then, and I like lowrise jeans or hot pants/short shorts very much. Yes I wear backless tops in the cold. I also like the cropped variant leaving my midriff bare, this is what I naturally wear along with lowrise jeans. What do you think of sleeveless very short minidresses? I have one that has slits on each side, revealing more than two inches of bare skin. Since I display a practically naked stripe from head to toe from the side, it is impossible to wear undies with this dress. I pretty much do not wear any underwear anyway, too many outfits do not permit this. So I gave up ;-) I wore that dress yesterday for a night on town in many degrees below freezing weather. Guess what, all my friends showed up in jackets, pullovers, skirts or jeans. Nicole at at least wore a mini skirt, albeit with thick woolen tights, and she was shivering a bit harder than the others. I was shivering by the time the bus picked me up after several minutes of waiting, and shaking when we met in town. I did not find a matching jacket for the dress because the dress would stick out underneath which looks ridiculous. I do not own any longer jackets. The only solution was not to bring any jacket which prompted weird looks and quite a few comments from my friends. They too wonder how I can be warm enough which of course I am not ;-) It is these looks and comments from my friends and sometimes even strangers that give me a kick, a rush of adrenaline. Kind of warms me from inside even though I am shivering and sporting loads of goosebumps on slightly bluish skin. Then there was this new pair of sandals which I wore for the first time that night. After two hours my feet hurt so bad that I had to take off my shiny new strappy sandals and walk barefoot on the frozen ground. Ugh, was that cold! But I think you can imagine that it was still better than bruising my feet. Another two hours into the night I was freezing so much that I shivered uncontrollably in waves. I did not want to spoil the great evening so I just toughed it out as we went on through town to get a meal. The cold went up from my bare feet through my bare legs to my private parts, drawing every little bit of heat from me that might have been left. On the bus back home people stared at me and could not believe what they saw: a girl having fun in a minidress despite the subzero windy weather. That said, I needed over an hour in bed to get reasonably warm again.
Helen, do you like to wear backless (or bare-midriff) short tops in the cold as well? I hope you give barefooting another try soon ;-) Do you ever catch a cold? How do you react then, do you continue to go barelegged in backless tops? I guess that's what I tend to do as I have gotten used so much to this clothing style that I cannot do without against better judgement ;-)

<p>Hi Lissy, Sorry its taken so long to reply, I had aproblem with my password. Yes I love to wear backless tops and nearly always have a bare midriff even in winter. Unlike you I do not like jeans or trousers I like my legs bare no matter how cold it is.
Yes I have been barefoot over Christmas on several nights out. I will tell you more about it later.</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,
Yes I have bought some vry short hot pants. They are low rise and very, very short. I wore them to the theatre just before Christmas with a short strappy top. Being 6ft tall I have very long legs so in these increadibly short hot pants I was showing a lot of bare leg and midrift. I dont know what shoed you wear with hot pants but even though it was cold I went barefoot. Several people remarked how sexy I looked but could not believe I had so little on in the middle of winter.
You asked what I wear to work, it is usually a short skirt, strappy camisole top and high healed sandals. Except for the odd day a month I have stopped wearing knickers to work, very daring really. Several of my female work mates say I should wear a bra (I am a 32D) but I gave up wearing bra's when I went to University 10 yars ago and don't own any. You say you dress differently to work do you wear undrwear at work or just leave it off when you go out at night? Do you ever wear tights at work?
For New Year I and a group of 9 girls went to Prague for a few days. It was Clare's birthday and we booked a hotel about 20 minutes walk from the main square. Clare said she was going to be brave for New Year's eve and wear a backless dress and sandals. She is not normally so brave, some of the others also said they would wear sexy dresses for the party at a big hotel in the centre of Prague. Not to be outdone I took my sexiest outfits. The one I wore for the party was a black dress that basically was a 2 inch wide strap that went round my neck and attached itself at the waist to the skirt part of the dress. It was held in place across my breasts by body tape. My back, sides and most of my front was completely bare. I had to rely on the body tape to stop my breasts from being completely exposed. I wore the dress with very high heeled strappy sandals and nothing else. The weater was very cold and windy but I was determined to brave it out. Clare's dress was very restrained compared to mine, it was only a deep vee at the back but otherwis covered up. Because of the cold (minus 6C) she wore tights with her sandals, though she braved it without pants. Katie was appauled to descover this when Clare sat down and her private parts showed through her tights. She was even more supprised to find that 4 other girls and myself were bare legged and without pants. I realise what you mean when you said you had boughts o uncontrolled sivering, it happened to me after only 10 minutes of our 20 minute walk outside. My back, sides and brests were freezing and I was shaking uncontrollably. Katie was wearing boots, wool tights, wool dress, jacket gloves, scarf and probably loads of underwear. She said in a load voice she did not understand how I could be warm enough in only a body stocking attaching a strappy top. When I told her I was not wearing a body stocking and that the straps were attached to my bare skin with body tape she had a fit. Infact she felt my freezing back and sides just to verify I was telling the truth. This gave me a boost that someone knew I was almost naked in such freezing conditions. By the time we got to the hotel I was feeling sick with being so cold.
What do you wear with your hot pants and what do you wear on your feet with them? What do you wear on your feet with you low rise jeans? Have you been barefoot over Christmas?

<p>Helen and Lissy I dont know how you can go barelegged in such cold weather. I go barelegged in Summer but wear tights when it gets colder, then shoes instead of sandals. As it gets colder I wear opaque tights and in winter wool tights and boots. There seams to be a new fashion in going without knickers, I tried it once but was so worried when I sat down that I would show my private parts even though I had a knee length dress on. You must be very brave to wear mini skirts with no pants.

<p>I have been making a real effort this winter to wear bare feet in sandals as much as possible. I haven't worn stockings or tights for years and now rarely wear socks. When it is really cold, I tended to wear shoes without socks with a heel height depending on what I have been doing but now I try to wear sandals as much as possible. I do find that sandals with a platform are easier to wear in winter than ones with only a thin sole as your feet are kept above the ground but still look good. I find it is important to wear nail varnish too. I get lots of compliments and looks of admiration for wearing sandals in mid winter and the more you do it, the more you get used to it and don't notice the cold - keep up the fashion and I will too.</p>

<p>Just wondering, Hele, you say that you nearly always have a bare midriff, even in winter. Have you had your belly button pierced ? I find it adds to the look and draws lots of admiring looks - like bare feet in sandals in winter. However I don't show my tummy that often in public - only when my partner and I are going out. </p>

<p>Hi Pam.
Glad to hear you are going barefoot in sandals. If you used to wear socks I take it you wear trousers. Do you ever wear skirts in the winter? Yes I wear nail varnish all the time it makes a difference. Its been very wet and cold here so my feet have been cold but I wear thin soled sanals due to my height. If I go out in the evening I have started going barefoot. Its a great feeling especially with hot pants. I cannot find sandals to go with hot pants. What do you wear with them? Do you have a bare midrift? Do you ever go out barefoot.</p>

<p>Hi Helen its Sue,</p>

<p>I really admire you for being so brave in this cold wet weather. I have noticed on Friday and Saturday nights more and more girls go bare legged and in sandals. I have been trendy lately and worn hot pants but I wear them with thick black pattened tights and knee length high heeled boots. I think it looks great and I am just about warm enough. How you manage to go barefoot is beyond me. Your feet must be frozen and your soles must get really dirty. I asked some of my friends about going barefoot and they said perhaps in summer but not in winter. When I asked them how they can go bare legged they owned up to being cold but they thought it looked good. Several of them admitted they went without knickers when they went out a night. It appears to be a growing trend. When one of them got out of a taxi recently her skirt slid up and showed her bare private parts, she must have been frozen. When I pointed out what I saw she was very embarassed about it, but pointed out that I was the only one out of the six of us that was wearing pants,in fact the only one not bare legged. Am I the only person who things going without knickers is strange and just a gimmick? You mention you never wear a bra, what happens when you run or play sport arn't you uncomfortable? Don,t you feel the cold at all, you must be frozen all the time especially with a bare midrift. Surely you must cover up at times you can't have a bare midrift all day.</p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>

<p>Judging by what you are saying, I guess you must be a lot younger than me - I am a mother of two lovely little girls, Lucy and Alice, and am in my early 30s. I wear high heels a lot and tend to have bare feet in sandals throughout the year when we go out in the evenings, in the past I tended to wear court shoes, especially black patent ones with a four inch stiletto heel. However, most of the rest of my body is covered up and I am too old to dress like you do !</p>

<p>Have you had your belly button pierced ?   I had it done when I was eighteen and loved it but took it out when I was expecting Lucy. I may have it pierced again when I am certain I am not having any more children. My partner and I are going out for a meal tonight and I will be wearing my strappy sandals with five inch heels and red nail varnish on my toes I am about to put on. Keep up the good work - I don't think I will be going barefoot - I am too old for that !  </p>

<p>Hi, here's my experience:</p>

<p>I am from Argentina and it never really freezes, but in winter it can be pretty cold and windy. Actually last winter we had the first snow in 83 years.
I wear practically always very short skirts, mostly tight denim ones, never tights and hardly ever knickers. For shopping, visiting friends and going to work or university I usually wear knee high boots, a short sweater or a short coat over my top. Compared to some of the posters here that's pretty chicken, but still many people wonder how i can stand the weather with bare legs and belly. When I go out for clubs or parties, that's quite often, I never wear a sweater or a coat - just a little top and I wear even shorter skirts and often loose ones from a lighter fabric. What I was going to tell you did happen about two years ago when I was for some months in Germany. It was about mid of October and the day had been quite nice, about 18C. I was invited to a party and there was to be a guy I really fancied, so I chose the sexiest clothes I had: some high heeled strappy sandals, a really, really short white micro skirt made from satin which was a wrap around skirt without buttons. It tied together over my bare leg with a gap of 2cm or so. My top was also white, it was a semi-transparent piece of thin fabric with two strings attached which were tied together on my back. It just covered my breasts (which are quite small). Besides that I wore nothing else.
I think fully clothed you can hardly be nearer to being naked.
OK, the party went really well, the guy couldn't let his eyes and his hands from me so we went to his place in his car.
I couldn't stay all night, so about five in the morning I left. In the meantime the temperature had dropped fiercely and there was glazed frost everywhere. I had no money with me so I couldn't take a bus or train, so I started to walk, which should have taken me about an hour or so. It was really cold but I felt fine and after a few minutes of walking it was also a very sexy feeling being practically naked out in the cold. As I was walking all of a sudden a strong icy wind came up and my skirt and my top were constantly blewn up - remember, both were only tied with one knot each. Now I really started to freeze and even more so as it began snow-raining. I began to walk much faster, almost to run which was no good idea as I broke one of my heels. I fell flat on the ground which hurt like hell. When I got up slowly I noticed that my top have gone off, the string was broken on the end, no way of tying it to together again. I was in a terrible state, my hair in a total mess, one of my knees and my left hand were bleeding (not very much, but it really hurt anyway as well as my breasts), I was wet and my front side was totally dirty from the ground, both my skirt and my top were soaked and had gone from slightly transparent to completely see through and my skin was so cold that the icy bits in the rain didn't melt imediately. I tried to go on walking, but couldn't with the broken heel so I took my shoes off, left them there and started to go bare feet. I felt absolutely miserable, I was sobbing and shivering, my teeth shattered and my totally wet skirt clung to my legs. At least like that it wasn't blown up anymore by the ever icier wind, but actually I couldn't have cared less in that moment. I walked slowly, like a robot, holding my destroyed top against my chest which was absolutely ridiculous as it had become useless and totally transparent. I don't know exactly how long I kept walking, everything blurred, I'm not even sure whether I walked in the right direction. When I was crossing a bigger street a car stopped by me and its door opened; I got on the car without thinking. Inside was a guy who took me to his home and then put me into the hot tub. He possibly saved my life, but surely my health - I didn't even get sick.</p>

<p>That was by far my most extreme experience with the cold</p>

<p>Hi it's Helen.
Yes I do go with a bare midrift all the time. Yes it is very cold at times but my tops are all short. No I don't have my belly button pierced, I'm too much of a coward, but I do at times stick a jewel on it. I find being braless comfortable,wearing a bra restricts me. If I play sport it is uncomfortable and I may have to buy a sports bra but for the time being I do not own a bra of any sorts. In really cold weather, especially if there is frost on the ground, going barefoot is cold. My toes are often red with the cold. I don't know anyone who goes barefoot in winter that doesn't have cold feet. Yes my feet do get dirty,but I do think barefeet looks great with hot pants. I don't know how you can wear tights Sue, I find them really uncomfortable and my legs are too hot in them. When I get older I will have to cover up more but I will never wear tights or stockings. Trousers are a no no for me I just don't like my legs covered. My coldest bodily was when I was in Prague as I descrided before, I was absolutly shaking with the cold. It was minus 6C and if I had been out any longer I am sure I would have got hypothermia. My almost bare breasts and back were  blue with the cold. I was so cold that night it did spoil the evening. The coldest my feet have been was last year when I was waiting an hour in the thick snow with only very strappy sandals on. I couldn't feel my toes for hours afterwards. Have any of you been in snow for so long in strappy sandals with bare legs? What age do you think is too old to go out barefoot or with very revealing tops? Do any of you wear more than a thong/G string do some of you actually wear pants? Have any of you worn sandals with tights?</p>

<p>Hi Helen.  I'm in my 30s and have found that I've actually started wearing skimpier outfits over the last few years - not quite as skimpy as yours, but still quite sexy.  My husband encourages me to wear sexy outfits, but always lets me decide how far to go.  A few years ago I would always wear trousers with socks and trainers in the winter, but now I rarely wear trousers, only cropped ones, and never wear trainers - it's nearly always skirts with either sandals or bare feet, and as for tights, they're definitely out!  I find that I can bear the cold on the bottom half of my body, but generally have to wrap up warm on top.  This means that I'll often go out with a thick jumper or jacket with a skirt or cropped trousers,  bare legs and feet.  If I'm going out pubbing or clubbing, however, I'll sometimes brave the cold and wear a little black dress or a backless top and short skirt.  I went out with some friends the other night after it had snowed, the temperature was minus 2 degrees. I asked hubby to choose an outfit for me - he picked a low cut black top, short black leather skirt and flat black flip-flops.  When I met up with my friends, a couple of them were wearing trousers &amp; boots, one had a short skirt with thick tights and boots on, and one had a long skirt, tights and boots.  I was the only one with bare legs! After a bit, I slipped my flip-flops off and put them into my handbag, where they stayed for the rest of the evening.  We went round a few pubs, then for a meal, then onto a club.  Next time we go out, I'm going to challenge them all to wear the skimpiest outfits they dare and I'm going to try and beat them all!!</p>

<p>Hi Helen,
sorry I have been busy for a while. Wow, you must have been THE sight at the party in Prague in your sexy dress! I can imagine how your friend could not get over you wearing almost nothing in that cold winter night. Amazing that you get a boost from that, since I practically feel the same, the colder it is and the stronger the reactions are, the better. You mentioned that your freezing spoiled the evening. Does that mean you didn't enjoy yourself any more? I admit that I am sometimes on the verge of hypothermia as well, but this goosebumpy shivery feeling is still great for me, even a bit arousing ;-) When I brave the cold in next to nothing I always try to hold back the shivers as long as I can, a little coolness game I like to play on my friends, though I mostly lose in the end. Not against my friends of course, merely the shivering ;-) By the way: I do not wear long trousers either, my lowcut jeans are shorts or hot pants ;-)</p>

<p>=>do you wear undrwear at work or just leave it off when you go out at night? Do you ever wear tights at work?</p>

<p>I wear neither tights nor underwear at work. The dress code permits knee-length skirts which I deliberately interpret as "about knee-length", so a good part of my thighs shows. My colleagues as well as the team leader got used to my clothing style, at least they accept it with a sigh and sometimes admiring glances ;-) I don't ever wear tights as I find them uncomfortable, hot and sweaty when they cling to the skin. I think that underwear only makes an outfit bulky, just like jackets. Moreover, panties do not fit under low cut shorts or skirts, so I do not bother and always forgo underwear.</p>

<p>=>What do you wear with your hot pants and what do you wear on your feet with them? What do you wear on your feet with you low rise jeans? Have you been barefoot over Christmas?</p>

<p>I wear short sleeveless tops with my hot pants, often midriff-baring and backless ones. Sometimes sheer blouses which I like to tuck up and knot in front, revealing my tummy. Like I said I never wear jackets since they spoil the look. My favourite shoes are strappy sandals with rather low heels or flip-flops as I am very slim and quite tall (about 6 feet like you). I went barefoot over christmas indeed, but my longest barefoot experiency was on New Year's Eve. I went to the big open air party at the Brandenburg gate in Berlin. Two of my friends were with me and we were looking forward to dancing and partying all night long. Both of my friends brought their clubbing gear, probably to sport it under their jackets which would come off in case we happened to chill out in some club or other later that night. But I wasn't sure if they might wear it to the open air party, so I wore the skimpiest rags I brought along, not wanting to be outrivaled. It was a matching pair of top and mini skirt. Both are made of silver sparkling material: a bandeau top, merely two inches wide which hardly covers my breasts, and a very short skirt, not much wider than the top ;-) Of course there is no room left under that outfit for any underwear, so this was all I donned. In fact, I completely shave my private parts for the same reason, nothing shall stick out ;-) I put on my black strappy sandals and went out without a jacket, despite the bit of a cough that I had. I didn't care, I wanted to sparkle when I met my friends in the hotel lounge and on through the frosty night. As I had presumed, Nicole and Jenny both wore jackets, although they left them open to allow a glimpse on their dresses. Jenny wore a v-cut black dress with a long skirt and thick woollen tights. Nicole sported a skirt that exposed her bare legs from mid-thigh down to her feet in court shoes. It was a bit chilly in the hotel lobby and Nicole already had goosebumps on her legs, but that was nothing compared with the subzero degrees outside. A gust of wind hit me when we went through the door into the street. I was forced to hold my breath and immediately felt how much skin I was revealing when the cold air bit into my gooseflesh. Immediately my nipples tried to poke through the thin fabric of my top, which sent a tingling down between my legs. I was not sure if only the cold made them stand out, it aroused me quite a bit as they rubbed against the top. The thermometer at the pharmacy across the street read -2C. No wonder I was already shivering like mad before the hotel was out of sight. I tried very hard to suppress my shivers, and to some extent I succeeded, looking as cool and calm as possible. Only when I spoke my teeth were chattering, which I stopped promptly by clenching my jaws. Jenny could not believe that Nicole and I were barelegged: "You can't be serious. I tell you, you will be begging to go back to the hotel before the end of the year!" As we reached the party zone it was still more than an hour left until midnight but the place was already overcrowded. We found a bit of room to the side in front of the main stage, where some local bands played their recent chart hits. The hours went by in a rush, we were dancing and laughing. The exertion let me forget how cold it was though I had still goosebumps and my skin had turned bluish. I was reminded when we fetched something to eat and had to queue for a couple of minutes. Standing almost still in the cold winter wind made me shiver in no time, but the gazes, cat calls and some nice comments from several cute guys surely made up for it. Midnight came, we drank to a happy new year and admired the fireworks above the city. During this quarter of an hour I felt the cold seeping into me again while standing there motionless except for my ever increasing shivering ;-). As if this was not enough, it started to snow! The flakes settled on my bare bluish skin and hardly melted. Now I was not only cold but also wet ;-) Perhaps you can imagine how it feels to stand still in icy gusts of wind when your shivering freezing body and skimpy clothes are wet - simply great ;-) The dripping wet top fit even tighter to my boobs an my nipples became even harder, easy to see for everyone. I was so turned on that I simply ignored the cold and my occasional cough. We danced for another hour or so and finally headed home to the hotel because our feet hurt. The snow had made the pavements slippery and I just couldn't bear to walk in my sandals any more under these circumstances. Naturally I took them off and set out barefoot. Jenny only shook her head and frowned: "How can you be warm enough in that dress with only that flimsy fabric covering your midriff and shoulders, and now even without shoes? You must be freezing!" I replied that I wasn't wearing a dress, but a two-piece with bare midriff and bare shoulders. She shrieked as she touched my cold wet belly. "And the flimsy fabric is gooseflesh" I added, smiling through chattering teeth. Her touch and the feeling that she now knew I was almost naked in such freezing conditions and on top of that despite having a cold gave me a boost, I felt totally exhilarated and aroused. "Oh well" Nicole suddenly meddled "since I am already cold and shivering anyway, I also might as well take off my jacket." Jenny was totally taken aback and stared at her unbelievingly and open-mouthed as she did. Nicole's dress was tame compared with my outfit, but it sported gossamer sleeves and a plunging neckline which revealed nice goosebumps on her cleavage ;-) I suggested having some berliners from one of the stands along the street. Nicole did not object although she was already shivering visibly, but she didn't put her jacket back on either. Meanwhile the snowflakes had soaked her dress and her wet skin was glistening. She cringed with every gust that hit her slender frame since she had not been able to put on anything but a low-cut top under her tight-fitting dress. She held her breath especially whenever a gust went under her skirt - she wore no panties either which we could see when the wind blew up our skirts. Fortunately there was no one near at that short moment. We smiled at each other while we were chewing our berliners, and suddenly Nicole winked at me. We were having fun, whereas Jenny continued to shake her head time and again as we went in our hotel rooms to get some sleep at least until breakfast. Of course I needed a hot shower, but I was too tired and fell right into my bed where I shivered for half an hour before I fell asleep and dreamt sweet dreams, still shivering ;-)</p>

<p>=>Have any of you been in snow for so long in strappy sandals with bare legs? What age do you think is too old to go out barefoot or with very revealing tops? Do any of you wear more than a thong/G string do some of you actually wear pants? Have any of you worn sandals with tights?</p>

<p>I have been in the snow for more than two hours and a half both in flip-flops and barefoot on New Year's Eve ;-) I think as long as you feel young and your body is still in good shape, have fun and flaunt it and hit the streets in skimpy clothes revealing a lot of skin no matter how cold it is :-) It is not a matter of age or what other people say. As long as you are comfortable half-naked in cold winter nights, go for it! Other people and even your friends are just jealous that you can brave it while they don't even dare going without a jacket, let alone show some skin! I never wear any pants <em>shudder</em>. I think tights look like a peel on me, bare legs are much prettier and sexier with sandals. I do not wear any bras either, though my breasts are smaller than yours  (more like a B than C). If you feel cosy without a bra, do not bother what your mates think of it, these are <em>your</em> breasts after all. Ten years from university (first-year or graduation?), I think we are about the same age then ;-).</p>

<p>You plan on covering up more when you get older? I hope this won't happen too soon, preferably never...;-) Do you cover up when you have a cold?</p>

<p>Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Sue,
sure it's cold and sometimes I am freezing my butt off, but you get used to the cold over the time. I have continued to stretch my summer clothing season through autumn and finally into winter for some years. I am sometimes cold like ice but I don't care, I just brave it. I think I'm also arguably toughened. Granted I catch some cold or other, but who does not? Even if I am sick more often I don't care, the fun I have is worth it a zillion times. I have also noticed the trend of girls being bare legged all the year. In my opinion it just looks better and the girls feel probably sexy. Going without knickers is just the next logical step because under short skirts or tight hot pants there is no room for winter gear ;-) You even have to shave your private parts then lest any hair sticks out down there ;-)</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,
Yes the cold did spoil the night at Ne Yea. It was -6c but with a strong cold win it was proably -12c. I had vertually nothing on at the top and very little on altogether. My back and sides were really cold but my almost bare breasts really ached with the cold. I was almost an hour inside before my breasts stopped feeling raw and cold, it made me feel sick. Still its a fabulous dress forgettng cmments so I will wear it again but perhaps not in such extreamly cold conditions.  It is amazing how people who  rarely expose anything assume you have a body stocking or similar on when you are actually bare. As you found it really does give you a buz when they touch you and see their reaction when they realise you are bare.</p>

<p>Yes I am 30 as you worked out. As Pam pointed out I will have to cover up at sme stage bu not for a few years et. I am happy to have bare parts and I will always be bare legged and bra less. </p>

<p>You're really brave to be barefoot for so long in the snow at new year. I find my feet stick to te ground when it is so cold did you find this?</p>

<p>I notice you shave your private parts I just trim mine very short to leave a very short covering of hair. Yo were very daring to wear such a very short skirt witout even a gee string. Your private bits must have been on show everytime you sat down or streatched.</p>

<p>Regardig do I cover up when I have a cold etc. I only posses one jacket and it is short so my mdrift is always on show. I have about 20 pairs of strappy sandal, 6 pairs of flip flops but only one pair of hgh heeled hoes and a pair f bots for very deep snow if I can be bothered to put them on. So the answer to the question is no asI have no clothes that will cover me up. If  have a cold and its really really cold I would wear sandals or flip flops rather than go barefoot.</p>

<p>Magpie girl.</p>

<p>I agree with you, my top half does feel the cold more than my feet and legs, but I still have a bare midrift every day. </p>

<p>You sounded to be having fun with yor friends especially as you went barefoot for most of the night I bet your friends were amazed when you took your flip fops off and went barefoot in the snow. You mention you often wear jumpers and thicker skirts in the winter, do you wear much under them or just a bra and pants. You said you were going to challenge your friends to wear very little in winter weather, what is the least you will wear? What part of the world do you live and what reagion?</p>

<p>Hi Girls
Me and my friends are pretty much the same as you, and i always try to make sure i wear the least.
I tend to go for maximum exposure and minimum discomfort, so barefoot in winter is out. I know some guys find it sexy, but all guys are turned on by a virtually bare body. I always wear a hat, often a cowboy hat as this helps conserve body heat and keeps the shivering down.
My friends have really upped their game recently and I've had to take my top off a couple of times, the only way i could beat them. It isn't really any colder than wearing a bikini top or boob tube and of course the guys love it and it's great to see the effect the cold is having on your nipples. It's good to be seen carrying your top instead of wearing it, it  gives the impression you were too hot and decided to take it off.
Would any of you be prepared to go that far?
Katrina.   </p>

<p>Hi Katrina, You do seem to be really daring. As you know I wear very little most of the time but I have never walked arround topless in a UK city as it is not legal.You mention that you do not go barefoot in winter and that you wear a hat to help keep you warm. Before you took your top off what did you have on? Do you wear jeans or a mini skirt? What do you wear on your feet? Being totally naked on top must make you the centre of attraction. What do your friends think and what do they wear? It has been really frosty lately and minus 9 degrees C yet I have been almost bare at night in the town and I have gone out barefoot twice. I seem to be leaving my sandals off more and more. I am startng to enjoy being barefoot more and more. If you are brave enough to go topless whydon't you give barefoot a try?

<p>Hi Helen
 I don't really think i'm anymore daring than you and Lissy. I am actually in  the UK too.
It's extremely unlikely anyone would complain about you going topless late at night and if they did you'd just be asked to cover up, no big deal. I often wear open toe sandals, but don't really like going barefoot, never know what you might tread in and i don't like my feet getting too cold. All i wear apart from the sandals is a micro skirt when i'm topless, otherwise bikini top or tube top.
My friends wear pretty much the same now but so far they're too shy to take off their
tops, they do struggle with the cold a bit more than i do, i don't think they've worked out why i wear the hat yet! I haven't really struggled even in the really low temperatures and the guys love to see me without a top, my friends were a bit shocked the first time it came off, but i've done it 4 times now, so they know what to expect.
Why don't we make a deal Helen, I'll go barefoot this weekend, if you'll go topless?
What do you think?
Katrina. </p>

<p>Hi Katrina. Just a little tale for you. Last week I went on a course for work, it was residential and as part of team building across the country we had to share a room with a girl from another branch. As it was not that time in the month I had not packed or was wearing any undewear. when we arrived at the hotel we were given a number, after introductions we were told what number person we were shaing a room with. They were twin bedded rooms and the idea was to gt to know the girl you were sharing the room with. The girl I got was the same age as me, very nice but not adventurous with her clothes. The first night of the course we were free to go out and we all arranged (12 girls) to meet in the bar before we went out. </p>

<p>I had a shower first and came out into the bedroom wrapped only in a towel. Jo the girl I was sharing with went for her shower. When she came out I was naked sat drying my hair.  She was quite shocked to see me like that. She quickly dried herself and put her boy pants on and a bra. She then put on thick tights, a camisolle top, a waist slip and then a thick wool knee length skirt and a jumper. I was amazed how much she put on. She then got her knee length boots out.</p>

<p>She started to talk to me as I got dressed. I slipped on a micro mini skirt and a halter necked cotton top. She said don't you wear a bra on a night, to which I replied I never wear a bra I don't own one.  When I said are we ready to go she said you didn't put your pants and tights on. I replied I hadn't any pants with me and I never wear tights or stocking. She was completely taken aback and said she never went without tights. Jo put her boots on and asked if I was wearing boots. When I told her I was going barefoot she said you must be joking its freezing out there and put on her coat.</p>

<p>We met the other girs and most had bare legs. Only Jo had a coat on and she kept saying arn't you all cold. We went to various bars and clubs and whilst most of them could not understand how I was warm enough in bare feet and with a bare  back they were also amazed how wrapped up Jo was. </p>

<p>When we left the last club it was`very cold and Jo kept on saying you must be freezing now. I remmbered what you had said and I said no I am warm (which I was not) and undid my top and took it off. My nipples immediately stuck out and Jo had a fit. Another girl Pat said you must be frozen but then took her top off. Pat put her top on again after about 15 minutes but I kep mine off all he way back to the hotel about a 45 minute walk. I was frozen when I got my naked body into bed and looked at Jo as she took layer after layer off and put thick PJ's on.</p>

<p>Yes Katrina I have gone topless. </p>

<p>You say you wear very little when you go out at night, what do you wear to work. Do you ever wear tights? Do you wear a bra and pants? and what shoes do you wear to work?</p>

<p>Hi Helen
Well done you, doesn't it feel great to have the top completely off. Were any of the other girls shocked when you went topless, other than Jo, can't believe how much she had on. What was Pat wearing? Did she give any reason for putting her top back on?
Like you i never wear bra, pants or tights, not even for work. I work in a pharmacy so i have to wear sensible shoes and a white coat but i'm  naked underneath it and for some reason the buttons keep popping undone, not that many get done up to start with, occasionally just one in the middle if i'm  behind the counter on my own!
I did go barefoot as promised and will again this weekend but i can't really say it does anything for me. Will you be going topless again? Some of the clubs around here don't mind if you take your top off, you'll probably find the same where you are.
Have fun,
Katrina   </p>

<p>Hi Katrina. Yes the other girls were shocked. Pat was wearing a a knee lenght skirt, cotton tee shirt and high heeled sandals. The next day we discussed what we were wearing. Most were suprised I went without my top but even more were supirsed Jo wore so much. She admitted she always wears tights even in summer. Most of the girls sai they wear bras and thongs and ear shocked I wore no underwear at all even with micro mini skirts.</p>

<p>I will be going out tonight with some of my friends an I willhav nex to nothing on a usual. It is raining heavily so my top will be wet through so I will be taking it off later tonght.</p>

<p>Hi Helen &amp; Katrina
Love your idea of winter fashion, i bet you look fantastic with your tops off. Do your boyfriends know about it?
So what are you going to wear in the summer if your down to just micro skirts in winter? Will they be coming  off too?
Did you manage to get that wet top off last night Helen?
Love the idea of you working with that white coat practically open Katrina. Has it ever popped completely undone?
If you'd like to talk more my e-mail address is: Fifthdoctor1983@aol.com

<p>Hi Richard,</p>

<p>Good to hear from you. My boyfriend approves of the way i dress and encourages me to be more daring. Certainly won't be wearing anymore during the summer.
It's pretty much inevitable that the skirt will have to come off at some point - if my friends start going topless, which is more likely when it's warmer, what else can i do but go nude?
Yes, that coat has come completely open a few times, always seems to happen when a cute guy comes in.
Will email you shortly,
Love Katrina. </p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>

<p>How wet did you get?  My top was already off before i got wet, took it off in a club and someone pinched it, so when we decided to move on to another club i had to walk topless in the cold rain for about 10 mins. - my nipples seemed to love it, never seen them so big. My skirt got pretty wet too and was really clinging to me and quite see-through, obvious i had nothing underneath.
Let me know how you got on, 
Katrina. </p>

<p>Hi Katrina,</p>

<p>I got really wet. Like you my skirt clung to me and went see through. The top came off later in he evening.</p>

<p>How do your collegues at work dress? Do any of them wear their white coats over bare skin or do they wear clothes underneath. I take it that non of them wear it like you. What do you have on when you go to work before you change into your white coat? Have you ever worn a bra?</p>

<p>A couple ofweeks ago I went to the theatre with my boy friend, a chap that he had met at work and his girl friend. Mike, my boy friend, said I should dress as I normally do as John's girlfriend was supposed to be trendy. Even though it was a cold wet night I only wore a short alter neck backless top and a micro skirt. When we arrived John and Jeny were aleady there. She had on shorts over thick tights, UG boots, a polo necked jumper and a jacket. She nearly had a fit when she saw me . She did not understand how I could be warm enough. We sat in the bar and she was amazed that my feet were bare an wanted to feel how cold they were.  When I lifted my foot up her eyes nearly dropped out when she saw I had nothing on under my skirt. Peter was also gob smacked and didn't know where to look.Has this happened to you seeing you don't wear underwear?</p>

<p>I thought of you Easter Saturday. We went to a fancy dress party at a rich frieds house. I thought it would be inside but it was in a marquee in the field behind the farm house. The theme was th south seas. Mike went as a pirate and I wore a grass skirt. The weather was snowy and the marquee was freezing. We were there from 7.30p till about 2.30am. I had nothing on but the grass skirt. No top, no bra, nothing under the grass skirt an bare feet. After about an hour I was shaking with the cold, after about 5 hours I could not feel anything and we had to leave at 2.30 as I couldn't take the cold any longer. Most of the girls were well covered up. I think there was only 3 of us (out of about 40 girls) without tights on. I was the only one topless and barefoot. Most of the girls went as female pirates with jeans and boots with thick wooly jumpers. I did however get loads of male attention, lots of drinks to warm me up and loads of cuddles. When Mike took me home he had to have the car heater full on o get me defrosted. Do you get lots of male attention when you go topless?</p>

<p>You say you live in England, what part do you live in?</p>

<p>Hi my name is Sue and I live in England. I don't know how you girls can go out with so little on in cold winter weather. </p>

<p>The weather has again been very cold and whilst I love to wear sandals and bare legs in summer I wear tights in winter usually with boots and a very short skirt. In summer I did go without underwear but it is far too cold for me to do that in this weather. </p>

<p>The other night I went out with some of my friends and I have to admit some of them went barelegged in the snowy and icy weather. I wore opaque tights and knee high boots with a mini skirt and a strappy top. I was frozen so you must be Helen in bare feet and sometimes topless.</p>

<p>Katrina mentioned that she wore no underwear to work,what do you wear at work Helen. If you go braless don't people say anything. When I go braless I often get remarks, I'm a 36D so it is fairly obvious when I go braless. I usually go braless when I am not at work.</p>

<p>Hope you are warm enough Helen in this cold weather.</p>

<p>Hi Sue its Helen. You ask what I wear to work. Normally very little. I never wear trousers and always have short or very short skirts. My legs are always bare and I wear strappy sandals even when it snows. I don't like to be wrapped up so I never wear a coat and only have cotten jackets on if it is really cold. I don't have any bras so I never have one on, I'm a 34D bust. As I am very tall the tops I wear show my bare midrift so I usually wear skirts quite low on my hips. Unless it is that time of the month I don't wear pants I prefer thye freedom of going without, though I have to be careful when I sit down.</p>

<p>I really don't know how you can bear to wear tights, dont you feel hot?</p>

<p>Do you always wear underwear even when you are not at work?</p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>

<p>Yes I usually wear underwear especially at work. Sometimes I go braless in the summer when I am not at work. </p>

<p>I dont know how you can go braless all the time nor do I understand how you dare go to work in short skirts and no pants.</p>

<p>In cold weather I don't feel hot in tights. I would be absolutly frozen dressed like you. At new year it was a cold night and I knew we would be outside a lot so I wore two pairs of tights, boots and thick underwear. I thought I was brave warieng shorts but some girls had bare legs. They must have been frozen. Did you have bare legs Helen? What sort of a coat did you have on?</p>

<p>Hi girls</p>

<p>I do find it surprising how the amount of clothing worn varies so much during the cold weather with some girls wearing layer upon layer and others wearing virtually nothing.
I don't really feel the cold that much and so tend to do the latter, especially when i'm out with friends.
I haven't actually gone topless yet but i think i would if one of my friends did. I did go barefoot in the snow once for a dare though. Perhaps i should be brave and give it a try?
I also live in England, in the West Midlands.</p>

<p>High Ciarra,</p>

<p>As you can see I live in England and wear very little even to work. What do you wear to work? Have you ever worn tights?</p>

<p>In the evening I often go barefoot even in very cold weather. I have to wear sandals if it gets to about -5C as my feet freeze to the ground if I stand for too long i.e. in a bus queue.</p>

<p>Most of my friends wear more than me. I never wear more than one layer of clothes and they are usually very thin. My legs are always bare and my skirts are short for work and micro mini in the evening. My tops are always short so my midrif is always exposed to the cold air. Many of my friends say seeing me wear so little in the winter makes them feel cold especially as they know I don't wear any underwear.</p>

<p>Do you wear underwear?</p>

<p>I have never worn a bra for over 12 years, and don't own one. I have a few pairs of Gee strings (for certain times in the month) but I have never worn anything bigger.</p>

<p>My friends say I don't wear enough and that my midrif looks freezing and that my feet often go red or blue with the cold.</p>

<p>What do you wear when you go out at night?</p>

<p>Next time you go out try going barefoot. The best way is to leave home barefoot and not take any shoes with you. After about 15 mins your feet will feel cold but after about 30 minutes you won't feel the cold and your feet will enjoy the freedom. If you take shoes with you when your feet first feel cold you will be tempted to put them on, or when the first person says 'arn't your feet cold'. Once you get past the feeling cold phase I am sure you will enjoy it?</p>

<p>Many of my friends say I wear too little in cold weather and that at 31 I should wear more. Coming from England what do you think? My shortest skirt is just over 6" long and just covers my private parts but I have to be careful when I sit down.
I am 6ft tall and a size 10, I have a 32D bust, 21" waist and 32" hips and my legs are very long. My skirts for work are longer about 6" above the knee.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon</p>

<p>Helen</p>

<p>Hi Helen</p>

<p>You certainly have lots of questions
For work i wear a button through mini dress without bra or panties. It gets very hot in the office so often just unbutton it, slip it off and hang it on the back of my chair, my boss is quite old but doesn't seem to mind having a nude secretary. Sometimes when clients come to the office i'm not able to cover up in time.</p>

<p>This winter i've been going out at night in just a micro skirt, quarter cup bra &amp; open toe sandals and haven't found it that cold, although everyone assumes i'm absolutely freezing.</p>

<p>Having read about you and Katrina going topless i decided to try it Friday night. It was cold &amp; frosty, my friend Dianne said "you must be frozen" I said don't be silly my $%!@ are far too hot and unhooked my bra &amp; took it off. The cold air on my nipples felt amazing.
I would of taken my shoes off too but didn't want to have too carry them.</p>

<p>Speak soon

<p>It has been cold but i don't think i've been anything like as cold as people assume.
I think seeing me almost bare makes other people feel cold. The longest I was out was probably about an hour.
Do you see many girls dressed like us ?

<p>Hi ciarrra,
      My freind had jeans and a jumper and thick coat and hat on with bare feet and high heeled sandals when it was very frosty out and she said her toes where freezing and they went very red , which i find very sexy. I dont see many girls out with not many clothes on sadly most of the women round here wear boots and jumpers . but i have seen a few which just look so so sexy to me and they stick in my mind . would love to go out with someone like that :-)</p>

<p>does your skin go very red? do you also shiver? thats a turn on for me i thought i was weird likeing that but it seems a few people like it :-))</p>

<p>Hi Andy</p>

<p>Have you seen any girls wearing as little as me in the cold weather ?</p>

<p>I do shiver a bit when i first go out into the cold but not usually after that, my skin can go a little red if i'm out for a really long time, but it doesn't show that much and i don't really feel too cold. The one thing that can be a problem is getting chapped in the wind and that  isn't  a good look ! </p>

<p>Hi Ciarra,</p>

<p>I have never been naked in the office that is very daring. Glad to hear you have been out topless yes it does give you a thrill when the cold air hits your nipples.</p>

<p>Sorry you never made it in bare feet as I  said try leaving the house in your bare feet then you don't have to carry your shoes. For the last few weeks I have not worn any shoes when I have gone out. Its been a bit chilly at times especially last Friday as it was frosty. I too took my top off and let the cold night air pirk up my nipples. We were outside for about an hour before we walked home, so I suppose I was topless and barefoot outside in the frosty night for at least 2 hours. My friends were all covered up, some even had coats on, most were wearing boots and some even wore tights. What was your friend wearing when she said you must be frozen?</p>

<p>Helen</p>

<p>Hi boys,</p>

<p>Yes boys I wear very little, so does Ciarra. Don't your girlfriends give you a treat? Are they always well covered up outside?</p>

<p>Yes it can be cold almost naked, but its the way I like to dress. I do't like to be too covered up.</p>

<p>Hellow Ciarra and Helen.</p>

<p>How you can wear so little is beyond me. Going naked at work is beyond belief, I don't know how you dare do it Ciarra.</p>

<p>It appears that I am behind the times. I never go without tights unless it is really hot. I have never gone without pants or a bra. In the weather we have just had I wear about 5 layers of clothes and have no flesh exposed except my face. If I go out on a night I always take a coat or jacket, You never know how cold it will get. </p>

<p>Being topless or barefoot when it is frosty would be agony to me, how you manage is beyond me. I don't think I could manage 1 minute never mind an hour or more.</p>

<p>What do your friends at work wear? I bet non of them wear so little, and I bet they all wear bras and pants.</p>

<p>The boys are right most girls you see wear much more than you two. I have never seen anyone wear as little as you.</p>

<p>Hi all its Helen,</p>

<p>It has been cold over the last few weeks what with all the snow and ice. Still I've managed in my usual gear. Couldn't wear high heeled sandles some days as it was too icy so had to make do with flip flops. My feet were cold sometimes but what else could I put on?</p>

<p>Went sledging some days and wore shorts, tee shirt and flat sandles, nothing else.</p>

<p>One night I did venture out to the theatre in a skimpy dress and bare feet. It caused quite a stir, and I got loads of comments. It still amazes me how much some girls wear. Yes I believe Helen when she said she wore 5 layers, some of my friends do.</p>

<p>Went to my friends house one snowy day and we made a snow man. Just so that I knew what it felt like I took my top off and helped the others build the snow man.  By the end of it I was quite cold and my nipples were sticking out more than normal, hardly suprising as I was topless with the snow falling heavily on my body. My friends were amazed how long I managed to stay topless, it was about 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Were any of you out with next to nothing on?</p>

<p>Hi Helen its Sue. Cannot believe you were topless in the snow. How you don't freeze is beyond me. When it was cold I wore a bra, camisole top, tee shirt, jumper and a lined winter jacket. I wore pants, thick wool tights, trousers, socks and boots.
10 items and you wore only 3.</p>

<p>You feet and bare legs must have been frozed, and you bare top must have been blue with the cold after a few minutes never mind 90 mins. How do you stand it. </p>

<p>Somedays you even go without pants, how do you dare do this in a short skirt. Arn't you afraid someone may see your private parts. You are the only person I know who dares to go out without pants.</p>

<p>Hi Suzy &amp; Sue,</p>

<p>Glad to hear that you like your top off Suzy, what do you normally wear and what do you wear in an evening. I too am astounded by how much Sue wears. Some of my friends wear a lot more than me but nowhere near as much as Sue wears. </p>

<p>A lot of my friends wear bras but the majority have now started to leave off pants, especially on a night. Gee strings are not the most comfortable and they, like me, have found that going without pants is very comfortable. Some of my friends in the winter wear hold ups, but hardly any of them wear tights. </p>

<p>Yes Sue I know that I may show my private parts when I sit down or stretch when I wear micro mini skirts, but I am sure most people don't notice or are not bothered by it.</p>

<p>I went with some friends to London last weekend. Wore very little as you might expect and went barefoot and didn't even take any shoes. Just for the record Sue one night I wore a very short backless dress so only had one item of clothing on (not your 10) the rest of the time I had 2 items of clothing on a micro skirt and a strappy top. That's right no underwear, no jumpers or coats and no shoes. My friends were similarly dressed except they had sandals on and Rosie wore a bra.</p>

<p>I agree with Suzy you must be very hot Sue with all the layers you wear. Have you tried wearing less?</p>

<p>Hi Helen &amp; Sue</p>

<p>I dress much the same way as you do Helen, i'm not so keen on barefoot though as i'm not as tall as you and like my heels, nothing to do with being too cold though.
I like to go out at night wearing just a micro skirt and no top at all. Topless seems to be acceptable these days so little point wearing one. besides I prefer to show off my pierced nipples anyway.
Do either of  you have any piercings?
What did your other friends wear in London Helen?
I think you're right about pants, so many girls go without these days. It doesn't bother me if people see all i've got 
You really should try wearing less Sue, you won't be as cold as you think.</p>

<p>Hi Suzy,</p>

<p>What do you wear during the day? You obviously cannot go topless all day.
Do you ever wear tights, underwear or coats?
What do you think of how much clothing Sue wears? Have you any friends who wear so much?</p>

<p>In London my friends wore very much the same as I did but they all wore shoes and often put coats on. One wore hold ups and boots and one wore a bra. As far as I know all seven of us wore no pants. Perhaps Cath did as I think it was that time of the month for her, I know she usually goes without.</p>

<p>Do you go topless most nights and do you leave home and travel on buses like that? I do not have any piercings or tatoos.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hi Helen</p>

<p>It's pretty much cropped tops and micro skirts during the day, no bra or pants though and just the skirt at night. It's usually a taxi or someones car but i would take the bus topless if i needed to.</p>

<p>If i'm  at the coast during the summer i don't bother with a top during the day either, i just wear a g string whether i'm on the beach, the Pier or walking along the main street and i have taken a bus to the next resort like that a few times.</p>

<p>I'm a horny young lady Helen and i like to show off as much as i can.</p>

<p>Like i said before i think Sue should try wearing less before she melts or something i 'm  sure she would be fine without a top.</p>

<p>Do any of your friends go without a top Helen &amp; what do you wear at the coast?  </p>

<p>Hello Suzy</p>

<p>Yes  I do find the winter quite cold but i see other girls going out in skimpy clothing &amp; I know I must do the same as it is the fashion. I decide i will be brave &amp; go without any top &amp; shoes. Again i feel ashamed at first &amp; apologize to club doorman but he say girls are often topless in club &amp; although i am the only one i not worry anymore.
Since then i always go without on a night out. I think in few years lots of girls will be topless like us.</p>

<p>Love, Pilar  </p>

<p>Hello Sue</p>

<p>I think perhaps you are a little shy rather than just worried about being cold. Sure you will feel little cold in winter &amp; like me you may feel a little ashamed to be virtually naked in public, but you will be used to it quickly &amp; not worry anymore.</p>

<p>Hi Pilar, Sue and Helen.</p>

<p>I still don't know how you do it. Yes I am shy but I would be frozen topless. I have never gone without a bra and would never go without pants. As the weather is a bit warmer I have cast my vest, but I still wear underwear and tights. My employer would not let me at work without tights, I am suprised that your employers allow you to wear so little.</p>

<p>You all mention what you wear at night but what do you all wear to work? Don't you have to be reasonably dressed?</p>

<p>How you can go out on a night topless is beyond me. Surely someone must say it is illegal to go topless in this country, and bus drivers where I live would not allow you on a bus topless.</p>

<p>How your feet remain warm enough Helen and Pilar I do not know. Besides your feet being cold don't you worry about cutting your feet?</p>

<p>You must have been frozen the other weekend Helen with only a dress on and nothing else. Don't your friends remark how little you wear? What do people at work think?</p>

<p>Do you all get remarks from other people how little you have on and don't men pass smutty remarks?</p>

<p>I don't go topless as much as Suzy but I do go topless at times. At the cost I always go topless.</p>

<p>As I have said I wear very little at work, just a thin top, a short skirt and sandals. No I don't wear underwear. I am allowed to work dressed like that, I would not work anywhere that made me wear tights.</p>

<p>Yes I get people saying arn't you cold and blokes looking at me, but I wear what I feel comfortable in.</p>

<p>Hi Helen</p>

<p>A couple of my friends are topless at the coast like when we go on the pier and stuff and sometimes in clubs, but not topless the whole night, i think one might now it's getting warmer though.</p>

<p>I'm barefoot at the coast if i'm  going to and from the beach etc. If as i occasionally do, just spend the day walking around the resort doing a bit of shopping and stuff then i'd wear heels, a lot of guys like that when you're practically naked.</p>

<p>Hi Sue</p>

<p>Keep on casting, you'll come to bare skin eventually.
Just strip down to the bare essentials and enjoy yourself, i'm sure there's a horny young lady in there trying to get out, after all you are reading this thread!</p>

<p>Work is a pain as i have a female boss who won't let me go completely topless but my blouse is virtually open most of the time. I work in an art supplies shop and lots of students come in to buy stuff. So many people ask to see my piercings that my nipples are on show most of the time anyway i'd really be better off with nothing on top.</p>

<p>Hello Sue &amp; Helen</p>

<p>Sue, I think Suzy is right, you are just looking for reasons not to try it. It is important for us to keep up with latest trends &amp; not let people think we are shy to show off our bodies, besides i don't think it is against the law to be topless.
Last night i am out walking my dog &amp; an elderly gentleman says he likes my outfit, all i have on is a micro skirt, he then asks if i'm  wearing pants so i just slip skirt off &amp; let him see everything, I think i made his day!</p>

<p>Helen,    I think you should always leave your top off when you're out at night, you're not shy &amp; you have no need to wear it. The men really like to see a topless girl so why not give them treat?</p>

<p>Love, Pilar   </p>

<p>As it has got warmer I tried going out with bare legs. I found it very cold and wanted my tights on. I lasted the night out but I was frozen. How can you go out in cold weather without hardly anything on? </p>

<p>As I have told Pilar I went out bare legged the other night. I was frozen and really missed my tights,</p>

<p>You mention that you have to wear a blouse at work but people ask to see your pierced nipples. How do they know you have pierced nipples if you are wearing a blouse? If it was not for your boss would you actually go to work topless? You mention that you wear heels to work are they shoes or sandals? If they are shoes what type of tights do you usually wear and what length is you skirt?</p>

<p>Hello Sue</p>

<p>You're bound to feel cold at first, give yourself time to get used to it you certainly don't need tights this time of year. It's almost Summer now Sue so why not pluck up courage to go out in just a micro skirt like we do, you won't take any harm without top now and you'll have plenty of time to adjust before the weather turns cold again.
I'm sure your boyfriend would love it too!
I don't work at the moment but if i did i would wear the least i could get away with.</p>

<p>Hello Suzy</p>

<p>It's a shame you not able to work completely topless, perhaps your boss will see how silly it is and change her mind, i'm  sure more guys would use shop.
I guess you would really like to work nude?</p>

<p>Hello Helen</p>

<p>I just wondered if you ever wear toe rings, i have 3 now. 
I guess when you said you had no piercings you meant apart from ears &amp; belly button?  That's  all i have, perhaps i should get nipples done?</p>

<p>Love to everyone
Pilar.     </p>

<p>Hi Sue</p>

<p>I really must agree with Pilar, just strip off and have some fun, nothing to worry about.
I do wear a blouse for work, well almost it's virtually open to the waist most of the time so i may as well not bother. When it does cover my nipples the jewellery can easily be seen though my blouse so everyone knows I'm pierced. I think i might just start leaving it off and see what my boss says, what do you think Sue?
That would leave me wearing just a micro skirt &amp; high heeled sandals, never wear tights.</p>

<p>Hi Suzy,</p>

<p>Don't think you will get away with it at work.</p>

<p>Since I last contacted you I have been fined for indecent exposure. I went out for a meal wearing a micro mini skirt and a skimpy top. After the meal I took the top off to walk to a club. I was stopped by the police and fined Â£50 for indecent exposure. It is a pity because I was starting to feel comfortable without a top.</p>

<p>I am still almost naked because the tops I am now wearing are see through but because I have a  top on I cannot be fined. However, they leave nothing to the emagination. </p>

<p>Please beware Pilar that being topless is still illegal in this country.</p>

<p>Hi Helen its Sue,</p>

<p>You must have been going to say something to me as you ended Sue. </p>

<p>I am not surprised that you were fined for going topless. It is against the law in England, however, I have seen several girls topless. How you and they are warm enough I still do not understand. I shiver if I leave my tights off, it appears that you, Suzy and Pilar wear next to nothing but I am sure you must feel the cold. To go almost naked in winter is remarkable.</p>

<p>I have gone on the internet and have found lots of Celebs who don't wear panties. How you are confident enough to do this I also don't understand. Arn't you afraid that your private parts will be on show and isn't it draughty.</p>

<p>You and Pilar appear to have given up wearing shoes, arn't you afraid of cutting you feet or picking up infections. In cold weather you must be frozen how can you stand your feet so cold? Have you ever felt how cold your feet are?</p>

<p>As the weather is warming up I intend to try and go without my tights and I may try going braless but I would never go without my pants nor go topless.</p>

<p>I'm surprised too, I think perhaps someone was over zealous, you shouldn't have been done for indecent exposure unless you were showing your genitals, i know it's easy to say but try not to let it put you off.
Good news on the job front, my boss says takings have gone up over the past year despite the recession &amp; realized my lack of clothing probably had something to do with it, so when I asked about going topless she said " yes, take it off straight away " I didn't need telling twice.</p>

<p>Hi Sue its Helen.</p>

<p>Yes I have more or less given up wearing sandals. I even go ton work in my bare feet. I have been barefoot now for about 2 months. Yes at times it is cold especially when we have the wet weather but my feet are more comfortable without shoes.</p>

<p>I have walked about barefoot for yeras and not got my feet cut so I have not thought about it. Being barefoot in winter is a bit more of a problem as your toes do feel very cold especially in frosty weather or snow, so I wear sandals then. I have felt my feet in winter and they are very cold but so is the rest of my body to the touch, but I hate covering up too much. If I have more than one layer on I feel cluttered up and uncomfortable and would sooner feel a bit chilly but have less on.</p>

<p>Glad to hear you are going to go without tights, how you could ever wear them is beyond me. Being braless is all I know I don't own any bras even though I am a D cup. Again I would feel too cluttered up if I wore a bra, I much prefer the freedom, I am sure once you have tried it you will prefer to be braless. Several girls I know have tried it and always go braless on a night, for some reason they are not confident enough to go braless to work, unlike Suzy who goes topless at work.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Amazed to hear your boss said you could go topless. I don't know how you can be topless all day in a shop with different customers seeing you bare. Don't you feel that people are looking at you. To work with just a micro mini skirt, thong and sandals is very daring. Don't you feel the cold at all. You obviously don't travell to work topless so what do you wear?</p>

<p>A shop is not a warm place so what will you wear on cold days?</p>

<p>I have gone bare legged and find it very cold but I have done it on several times now and am quite pleased with myself. I went without my bra the other night. I was very self concious and kept my jacket fastened most of the night. When it did warm up I took my jacket off and my nipples showed through my top. One of my friends remarked are you braless. I was so embarrased I put my jacket back on.</p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>

<p>I have been bare legged but not bare foot. I was cold without my tights on but I wore high heeled shoes rather than sandals. It would be too cold for me to wear sandals without tights. Your feet must be blue with the cold in winter.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your fine but being topless outside is a step too far. As I have said I have gone braless on one occassion and was very embarased when a friend noticed I was braless. How you manage never to wear a bra I cannot understand, especially as you are a D cup. Doesn't it bother you when you run and isn't it cold with only one layer on in winter. You mention your skin is cold to the touch in winter doesn't that bother you at all? In a micro mini skirt and bare legs in winter you must be frozen, how you manage with just a thong under your skirt I don't know. </p>

<p>Will let you know how I get on barelegged, don't think I will be going braless again.</p>

<p>Hi Sue,</p>

<p>To answer your questions Sue;</p>

<p>Yes my feet do change colour in winter usually to a purple shade if it is extreamly cold. As I have said recently if it is icy, very frosty or thick snow I wear sandals rather than going barefoot, but my legs and feet are bare. I never wear long skirts or trousers.</p>

<p>I have got used to my breasts moving about when I run but it a nice feeling. I  do excersises daily to keep my breasts firm and not droopy. I am very fortunate that even topless my breasts look firm.</p>

<p>Yes it can be cold with only one layer on in temperatures well below freezing, but I would sooner be cold rather than clutted up with clothes.</p>

<p>My skin is cold to the touch in very cold weather but most peoples would be so it does not bother me. Freezing temperatures with a strong wind are the worst for my bare midrift. Yes it is bare all the time, being tall means that any tee shirt shows a lot of bare skin, especially when most (if not all) of my skirts sit on my hips rather than around my middle.</p>

<p>All my skirts are cotton and unlined (I hate linings and woolen skirts) but my winter ones are mini rather than micro (unless it is at night) so are only about 6"to 8" above my knees. My micro ones are no longer than 6" so are well above my knees. I have very long legs. Yes my legs and thighs are very exposed to the elements and in very cold weather they do feel cold, but this has always been the case and is better than having covered legs. How you can put tights on is beyond me. </p>

<p>Having a thong on (at the most 2 days a month) makes no difference to the warmth but feels uncomfortable. Yes you have read it correctly Sue only 2 days the rest of the time I wear nothing, no pants or thongs just completely knickerless. Yes in my shortest micro skirts I do show my private parts when I sit down, stretch or bend over, but it is only for a short time.</p>

<p>Keep going bare legged you will love it in a week or so and probably never wear your tights again.</p>

<p>Hello Helen</p>

<p>I'm please that you still go topless, i never wear a top when i go out in the evening and often don't bother during the day when i'm  close to home. I don't see the point of wearing one because i prefer to show off my nipples, skimpy tops are useless any how. Its easier to just go bare, otherwise i take top off and have to carry it.
It's the same with shoes i end up taking off and have sometimes lost them or forgot to take them home so i seldom bother.
I think one item of clothing is enough for me, i look good in micro skirt and i'm proud to show what i have.
I live in Essex now.  </p>

<p>Went to the theatre Saturday, wore a very short micro mini and a see through top. Shocked the lady in front of me, she turned round and told me off that my top was completely see through. At the interval she turned round again just as I was about to stand up. She was completely alarmed I had no pants on, and was even more alarmed when the lady (about 40) sat next to me said it was too hot for pants and that she was bare under her skirt. I had a chat to this lady and she only wears a gee string in winter otherwise she wears nothing. She said she was too old to wear micro mini skirts and go braless but finds tights and pants too restictive. The chap to my other side thought I looked great and especially liked my bare feet. We went for a drink after the production. He was great!!</p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>

<p>Thanks for answering my questions.</p>

<p>I have left my tights off recently as the weather has been very hot and I have got used to being without them. In some of my shoes my feet rub but I have bought a pair of strappy high heeled sandals that are very comfortable. The weather has changed during the last two days but I have continued bare legged but my feet are cold and they get wet and very cold when it rains, however, I have noticed a lot of girls with bare legs so I will stick it out for the time being. Are you still barefoot in this weather?</p>

<p>How you and Suzy can go topless in public is beyond me. I feel very self conscious braless. I have tried it on an evening but would be afraid of doing it to work. I agree it feels great without a bra but my nipples are quite prominent and stick out making it very clear I am not wearing a bra.</p>

<p>I could never leave my knickers off, I even have a pair on in bed under my pyjamas. I guess that you only wear a thin nightie in bed and have a thin duvet rather than my 15 togg one.</p>

<p>I was pleased to note you do feel the cold in winter. I don't know why you don't wear more to keep you warm. I wear wool tights and lots of layers in very cold weather. It must be very cold having only one layer on and no knickers.</p>

<p>How you can wear skirts as short as 6" I don't know. They must only just cover your private parts. To go without knickers is asking for trouble especially in such a short skirt.</p>

<p>Hi Suzy.</p>

<p>My nipples are fairly dark and stick out. I would be very embarrassed if anyone saw them in public. To think strangers can see your bare breasts is amazing.</p>

<p>What piercings do you have through you nipples? In summer if your breasts are bare doesn't the metal get very hot and burn you? I know the metal arms on my sun glasses gets hot but something hot next to your nipples must be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Don't know how Helen manages in such short skirts without pants, how long are your skirts.</p>

<p>Have you tried barefoot? Helen is very brave not to wear shoes.</p>

<p>What do you wear in bed? What togg duvet do you have on in winter?</p>

<p>You are like Helen and wear very little do you feel cold in winter? Do your feet change colour with the cold. Do you ever wear tights or boots when it is very cold?</p>

<p>Hi Sue,</p>

<p>Glad to note you are barel egged.</p>

<p>Yes I am still barefoot, never worn shoes or sandals for over 2 months. I go to work barefoot and don't wear anything on my feet at work. A few days my feet have got very wet but they soon dry off.</p>

<p>Glad to see you feel great without a bra, gone without so long now I couldn't go back to wearing one. I even play badminton and tennis braless.</p>

<p>As you know I rarely wear pants (the odd day for time of the month) and never feel that I should wear knickers even in very short skirts. As I have said before a gee string does not give any extra warmth in winter so why wear one.</p>

<p>No I don't wear a thin nightie in bed, since I was about 7 I have worn nothing in bed. My mother used to put me in my bed naked. At guide camp I was the only girl not to put something on in bed, by the time I was a guide I had been sleeping naked for several years. Just to put the record straight I sleep naked with only a sheet even in winter(no duvet) and I usually fold the sheet down to my waist. How you can wear PJ's I don't know. To wear knickers in bed is unheard of.</p>

<p>I wear micro mini skirts to show off my legs and for comfort, I am not bothered if people see my private parts, I have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Hi Sue</p>

<p>I Think 6 inches is about right for a skirt, most of mine are about that length. When you've got nothing on top you don't want to be too conservative below the waist.
Prominent nipples are great Sue the harder the better, you should be proud to show them off, no need for anything on top at all in this heat!
I usually wear gold bell bars through my nipples, can't say i've had a problem with them getting too hot so far, could always remove them for a while if they did.
Sorry i've no idea what tog my duvet is, just throw it off if i'm too hot, sleep naked of course.</p>

<p>I'm topless all the time too at the moment, either a string or micro skirt but that's all
Actually went nude in a club Saturday night, just couldn't bear anything on my pu55y it was so hot. Don't know how you can put up with a top at work Helen?
Have been barefoot at work the last couple of weeks. must say it's more practical when  using step ladders &amp; stuff and nice and cool this weather, still like my heels though, like the way they make my t1ts jiggle when i walk.
Not really surprised about the older Lady not wearing pants, so many people don't
at these days!
Going nude clubbing again Friday, what about you girls?</p>

<p>As you know I was fined for going topless so I dare not go naked like you Suzy. I  actually go topless inside the nightclub but wear a see through top when I leave.
I wear a very short skirt that just covers my private parts. In the garden at home or in the house I am completely naked as you would expect. </p>

<p>What do your friends think of you being naked in town on a night? What are they wearing? Wasn't the taxi driver suprised?</p>

<p>Great to hear you like being barefoot, I have been without shoes for nearly 3 months now and will not be wearing any until the frost comes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am not allowed to go to work topless even being barefoot has been questioned.</p>

<p>Your right about people not wearing pants several girls at work have started to go without and like it. Hope Sue has tried it, see really does wear a vast amount of clothing even at home.</p>

<p>Hope you are still wearing next to nothing (or nothing).</p>

<p>Hi Helen its Sue,</p>

<p>In the hot spell I went without tights and even left my bra off at times.</p>

<p>On a night out I actually left my knickers off. My skirt was not ultra short although it was above my knees. It felt great but I was always fearfull that someone might see my private parts. Tried it barefoot as well but was not comfortable as I had to be very careful where I put my feet as I did not want to hurt them. How you can go without shoes everyday I do not understand.</p>

<p>Now it is colder and the rains have come I am back to wearing tights. Its too uncomfortable to wear sandals in the rain and normal shoes and bare feet is uncomfortable. Still leaving my bra off at times and have worn my tights without knickers even at work.</p>

<p>Are you more covered up now?</p>

 Did I read it correctly, you actually went to a club completely naked.
What did your friends think? Didn't blokes try to take advantage of you?</p>

<p>Do you actually go to work topless or take your top off occasionally at work?</p>

<p>I am surprised by an older lady going without pants, besides you three I don't know anyone who goes without pants.</p>

Sorry i have'nt  been by for a while.
I don't actually go nude until i'm inside the club, do tend to forget to put anything on before i leave though.
Still rarely using a top, just no need to bother and certainly never at work. Sue it sounds like you're getting into bad habits again, just chill! It's lovely weather to have your $%!@ out.</p>

<p>Hi Suzy its Helen.</p>

<p>Even though the weather has changed to much colder I am still in my bare feet, skimpy tops, very short skirts and nothing else. People at work are amazed that I am still barefoot. The other morning it was frosty and waiting for the bus my feet were starting to stick to the ground, so I had to keep moving them about. Others at the bus stop were dressed for winter never mind autumn.</p>

<p>Have you gone back to wearing shoes Suzy, I know you tried barefoot but you were not convinced that it was for you.</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>

<p>Where do you live?</p>

<p>Yes I am still dressed minimally and still in my bare feet. I have gone over 3 months and never had anything on my feet. My skirts are short by day but very short on a night some as short as 150mm so quite a bit of me is exposed. Yes you are right I very rarely wear undies and I never wear a coat. Some days it is cold but I don't like being cluttered up.</p>

<p>Hi Helen</p>

<p>Turning colder at last, you should have seen the size of my nips today!
I have been leaving my shoes off more but as you know i do like my heels, none the less i am prepared to give them up altogether. But only if you'll give up your top when you're out at night at least. I know you had a bad experience but you really need to put that behind you now. Just one layer is great, but zero layers is fantastic as you know.
Pilar is already topless and barefoot, so if i loose my shoes and you loose your top we'll all be equally exposed, well apart from Sue of course.
GO ON Helen, say you will. My toes are ready to meet Jack Frost!</p>

<p>Hi Suzy &amp; Pilar it's Helen</p>

<p>Yes I made it topless and barefoot. It was a freezing night and my friends thought I was stupid. The taxi driver could not stop looking at me, he even adjusted his mirror. Of course I lifted my leg to rub my very cold bare foot and he could see right up my skirt. I felt really sexy. </p>

<p>Being so cold my nipples were sticking right out and my friends were agog. Several of the party of about 12 girls thought I was wearing a body stocking and were more suprised to see I was barefoot. It was not until one of them actually touched me that they realised I was completely bare. It was quite a thrill for me being topless but it was very cold especially when it started to rain a freezing type of rain. I was really shivering as we were stood outside in the square for about 2 hours. My bare feet were also sticking to the frosty ground and were quite red.</p>

<p>How are you going on barefoot Suzy? What are you wearing on the way to work?</p>

<p>Pilar what do you wear during the day when you go for a walk?</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon. Helen</p>

<p>Hello Helen
I'm glad you topless like us now. I get used to your weather and prefer no top even daytime, i think it more practical than to wear skimpy top just for sake of it and it look
better.
Just before Christmas i see girl dressed like Sue on a night out. She have coat, scarf, boots, jeans, hat and i guess another three layers underneath. I know it snowy &amp; icy but she look really out of place, her friends just wear skimpy clothing and two have tops off like me. I see more girls dress like this now and often without shoe.
Hope you been enjoying cold weather topless?</p>

<p>Hi Martin
Yes it go very cold now but luckily it very still, no biting wind so far and it not really feel that cold.
Today me and friend play in snow in local park. She decide to wear her bikini, but i not wear any top, just g string. We built big snowman and not feel cold at all. I did feel a little ashamed at first because so many children stare at me but then two boys ask if i like to have go on their snowboard and i forget about not having top and my friend take hers off too!
After awhile i decide g string not cover much so i just take it off and play naked. It good way to overcome my shyness and nobody complain. Elderly lady cannot believe I'm naked in sub zero temperature, she really stare!</p>

<p>Hello again Martin</p>

<p>Yesterday we stay in the park for about 3 hours, just topless for first hour. Afterwards
I risk walking home naked as g string get wet in snow, friend put bikini top on though.
Today we go back as i want to enjoy snow while it last. This time i leave g string at home because i prefer to frolic as you say naked!
Today there are even more children because schools close in England when it snow and again i feel ashamed i wear nothing, then boys we see yesterday start throwing  snowballs and i not think about it again. We stay about 4 hours, my friend take her top off after about an hour and i hide it in the snow so she cannot find it anymore!
I think it a little colder today, my nipples get really big in the snow and my tummy and left boob a little chapped tonight. I get my boyfriend to put some cream on later.</p>

<p>Stay warm, Pilar.    </p>

<p>Hello everyone, I also want to share a recent experience with you:</p>

<p>On Sunday my girlfriend Nicole and I went to a film premiere. Even though it's been a really harsh winter till now, on Sunday it wasn't  extremely cold - just some degrees below freezing.</p>

<p>As it was about to be a special event, so I decided that it was the moment to dress really nicely. I put on a long red velvet dress, very classy, with a long slit over the right leg, black gloves, nice leather boots, stockings and a short jacket whilst for Nicole it had to be something really skimpy: She should wear a light coloured very thin satin dress - as short as it goes - showing a little bottom at the lower hem, completely backless so that a bit of her butt crack showed, tied with a string behind her neck and cut off in front well below her navel. At the same time it was quite tight around her hips. Actually this wasn't a real dress but a very sexy nighty, but who cares?</p>

<p>It was so thin that you could probably squeeze it completely into one hand - two for sure. This and some open sandals with very high heels was everything she was going to wear. She looked absolutely stunning.
Although Nicole is a very sweet and soft girl she's really tough when it comes to endurance, so she didn't hesitate much when I chose this outfit for her. We were going to take a taxi to the cinema but we were well in time, so we didn't call a taxi to our home but decided to just catch one on the street. </p>

<p>When we went out of the door Nici took a sharp breath as the cold air hit her. As I love it to see her as skimpily dresssed as possible she's used to dress very little on cold days - usually no coat and short skirts or dresses - but this night her clothes didn't offer any protection against the cold at all - it was pretty much as if she wasn't wearing anything. I told her to catch a cab which was a great sight as always when she raised her arm she would pull up her dress and expose her slit. With the dress being tight around her hips it did not just fall down afterwards but she had to pull it back. It was great that the first three taxis didn't stop. When the fourth one finally stopped I was already feeling the cold and Nicole was quite happy to get into the car. She got in first and sat behind the driver whilst I sat on the opposite side. I told her to come to the middle seat so we could cuddle a little and also to give the driver some glimpse under her skirt. He was looking into the mirror a little too much to really drive safely but eventually managed to get us safely to the cinema.</p>

<p>Getting out was quite a challenge for Nici as her dress was too short and too tight on the hips to sit down without uncovering her lower half, so quite some people got a good view of her as she got out the car.</p>

<p>Well, the film was quite OK, not really great, but actually we entertained ourselves quite well. As I had much better access to her, I kept Nicole really on the edge. When we got up she would have been ready to do almost anything just to get off. She had been sweating a lot during the last one and a half hours and was in a state of dizziness. Through a friend of mine we had two tickets for a festival party in a more or less nearby club and we already had planned to go there after the movie.
As the club was at only some 20 - 30 minutes walking distance I decided that we would actually walk. I felt the winter air when we left the building. It was colder now than two hours ago. If I had been alone perhaps someone would've thought "she's not really dressed up for the weather" but with Nicole being almost completely naked by my side, she inevitably drew all attention to her and her braveness. At first she didn't seem to bother, it must have still been the arousal that she didn't really feel the cold air, though she had problems keeping her balance: Over the last weeks it had been snowing a lot and on many places there was a thick layer of ice over the pavement and Nicole was wearing really high stiletto heels with a very thin and slick sole. My boots also had some heels but thick and solid and only perhaps half as high as Nicole's and my soles had some grip. Anyway it was an incredibly sexy sight to see her clumsily walking, trying to keep her balance on the slippery ground and pulling down her dress every couple of meters as it constantly was riding up as we were walking. </p>

<p>After a couple of blocks it happened what somehow had to happen: we were crossing a wide street and did so quite fast as there still was some traffic when suddenly Nici lost her balance, started to fall, tried to prevent it but eventually failed to and fell on her bum. 
I don't know how she mananaged to do so but the stupid thing had managed to break the heel of her right shoe - nothing there where it could have stuck or so. Less surprising her dress also didn't survive the fall intactly. The complete left side was ripped from the lower hem to just where the fabric passed from her front to her back. Just the upper seam still hold it together. The fall had definitetly brought her back to reality. For a moment she was lying flat on her back on the icy ground, the dress pulled up to waist. She slowly sat up and I could see she was holding back tears. I asked her if she had hurt herself badly. She shook her head and said "no - it's nothing serious, it just hurt like hell - but I'm so sorry. I know you wanted to go to this party and now we can't". I started laughing "I can understand that you're ashamed that you've made such a mess of yourself, but of course we're still going." Nicole, still sitting with her bare bottom on the ground, asked how she could go like this to which I replied: "just take off your shoes and we'll go". Of course she couldn't go on walking with her broken heel, so she took her shoes off and I helped her up. Her backside had become really dirty and I cleaned her a bit with my hand. She looked so miserable and so sexy at the same time: She stood there bare feet, with nothing on but this torn pretend-to-be-a-dress. We went on walking hand in hand this time and after a couple of minutes she started to shiver. I can't imagine how cold she must have felt - her bare feet on the ice, bare legs, bare back, bare shoulders, bare arms and everything open in the front in cold winter breeze. i don't know how she managed it, but she didn't complain. On the other hand I could see the relief in her eyes when we reached the club. </p>

<p>As we entered we caused quite some head turnings, but not a big sensation. I think that was because it was mainly film and press people there and also a lot of other good looking girls. I suppose that many thought that Nici's outfit was a kind of costume and we had arrived by car. </p>

<p>We had a fantastic time a the party, I might write under another topic about it - it just doesn't belong here, only that, when we left at about 3 o'clock I believe there was nobody in the club who hadn't seen Nici's most intimate parts, that she was almost completely drunk and that her whole body was so covered with sweat that the shreds of her dress (the little piece of fabric that had hold together left side of her dress had been broken too) had become transparent and was clinging to her body. </p>

<p>Outside it had gotten still colder and there was also a little bit more of wind. We walked to the bus stop to take the night bus home and you could see that she was really cold. She was shivering a lot as we stood waiting for the bus. Lucky for her we only had to wait a few minutes. Inside we went to the upper floor well to the back. Once we sat I massaged her a little and she rubbed her feet and slowly regained regained her senses. As this had been such a fantastic night I thought about how to give it another twist and so I started to tell her that I was really upset with her that she had been wrecking her shoes and her dress - both gifts from me. Nicole apologized a little bit half-heartedly, she had had a great night and was now tired, wasted and still very cold - she probably suspected that a good spanking was awaiting her at home (which was exactly what I had in mind), something she always feared but also was looking forward to.</p>

<p>When we got out of the bus she was nervous and tried to convince me - still not very convincingly - not to punish her. Before we were getting to our flat we had to cross a little park. Nici's bare feet sank into the snow as we were walking. When I saw three guys approaching from the other side of the park I suddenly had a much better idea for her punishment. When we were about to pass the guys  who couldn't take their eyes off Nici's almost naked body, I stopped them and asked them their opinion about her negligence of my gifts to her and they totally agreed with me that such behaviour deserved punishment. Nicole didn't really agree but she was too busy stepping from one feet to the other to really object against it.</p>

<p>I then explained what i had in mind. I said that Nici needed besides from the punishment some physical movement to warm up, so it had to be some kind of a snowball fight. Right where we were standing there were four trees marking almost a square with sides of perhaps 10m or a little more. Nici had to stay inside the square and not leave it by any means whilst we others would stay at one of the four edges, one at each edge and trying to throw snowballs at her. The guys thought this was a great idea whilst Nici looked rather shocked but when I told her to get into the middle she did so. We each took our position and started the game. The guys were really good at aiming and right at the beginning she was hit by couple of snowballs then she got better at eluding them. Of course as she was running around she fell down quite often. These were the moments when it was really easy to throw at her. At one point the knot behind her neck opened and she lost her dress completely. She tried to grab it again to put it on again, but this was totally futile as she would hve to stand still to do so and then the snowballs came hard and fast, so she had to let it go and just stay completely nude. Soon she was beginning to loose her strength and fell quite often on her knees. Then she really got it well. It must have been really, really tough for her. My gloves weren't that thick and my hands were beginning to hurt from the cold when Nici finally gave up and just stayed laying in the snow. That's when I told the guys the game was over. </p>

<p>It was pretty obvious that they had expected to have still some other kind of fun with Nicole or even the both of us but there was no way this was going to happen. So I helped Nici up, she had been crying a little but when I told her that she was such a brave little girl, she smiled and surely felt very proud. There was no point in putting her dress on again, so  I just walked her to our flat where we took a nice hot bath together.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want to hear more from Nici and me</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>

<p>Yes it has been very cold this last month and a half.</p>

<p>New year was really cold and whilst I was not naked I did go out very skantily clad. I have worn short skirts and skimpy tops to work and very thin outfits on a night.</p>

<p>On New Years eve I wore my sexy dress. It has a very short skirt part and the top is only a thin band that goes round my neck and just covers my nipples. My breasts are quite exposed and there is nothing at the sides or back. I wore only this dress even though it was -12 C. </p>

<p>My bare feet stuck to the icy ground and I got frost bite for the first time. Very painful for a few days and my toes turned black. Had to put flip flops on for a few days, but back barefoot after that.</p>

<p>I was stood out in the square with my boyfriend for about 5 hours it was he who noticed my toes going black rather than the normal red colour that they go in the cold. My body was also very cold, but I hate being too covered up. There were some girls wearing as much as Sue. Boots, tights, wooly clothing, scarves, coats, gloves and a hat. Far too much for me. I do not have a coat, gloves, scarf, hat or tights, and I never wear any shoes except strappy sandals or flip flops even in thick snow.</p>

<p>I have been topless in the snow on several times.</p>

<p>What did you wear on New Years eve Suzy?</p>

<p>Helen,</p>

<p>I think you managed to be the toughest woman out there - this is quite crazy! 
Frostbite is very serious. If something turned black it means that you caused a (probably permanent damage) to yourself. It's definitely incredibly sexy to be seen by everyone almost (or completely) naked in the cold, causing yourself harm - I think - is a little too much. I also hate being covered up, for me it's always bare legs and tummy and nothing under my micro skirts - but I'd never go with bare feet for more than a short while if it's freezing (well, I happen to love my high heels, so it's not so often anyway). I love being exposed, not to freeze to death. <br />
Anyway, at the moment here (Argentina) it's summer, so no problem with that right now...</p>

<p>I admire you a bit for being so tough, but I'd prefer if you considered a little bit your health.</p>

<p>Hello Helen</p>

<p>Hope you are okay!
I not suffer any damage in cold weather apart from chilblains on my ears, so have to wear woolly hat. It not been as low as minus 12 here though!
Some days i wear micro skirt  and some days g string, but i have no need for top or shoes even when it snow, and when I play in the snow I wear nothing.
Yesterday afternoon me and my friend are walking to park, I am naked and carrying sledge and she is wearing bikini bottom, when an elderly man approach us. I feel ashamed i have nothing on and expect him to complain, but instead he ask friend why she wear bottom. She is very embarrassed when he suggest she take it off. He tell her it not keep her warm, so she not need it!
When we get to park she decides he is right and take it off. 
We have lots of fun in snow and stay until dark. </p>

<p>Love, Pilar.  </p>

<p>Hi Pilar its Helen.</p>

<p>I am fine and the frost bite soon cleared and my feet are OK. It was a warning to me so in really cold weather I wear flip flops now. Since the weather was only really cold for a few days, I only needed the flip flops on for a few days. I am barefoot again and love it. </p>

<p>How you managed to be naked for so long in the snow and also barefoot is beyond me. As you know I was fined for being topless never mind naked in public. I know once your body has got used to the cold you don't need many clothes but to be naked for hours in the snow is incredible. Do you ever wear shoes or a top?</p>

<p>I recently went into Marks &amp; Specer with a girl friend of mine. She wanted to buy a gee string. I was wearing a short sleaved blouse that ties in a knot at the front (it has no buttons) and a micro skirt. A lady from the undies department stopped us and asked if she could check we were wearing the correct bra size. My friend said yes and the lady took us into a changing room. She asked me if I knew my correct bra size and asked if she could measure me. She had an absolute fit when I undid my blouse to reveal I was braless. She could not beleive I never wore a bra and expained in depth that with a bust my size I should always wear a bra. She then looked at my feet and saw I was barefoot. I explained that I rarely wore shoes and she was suprised when my friend said that she had never seen me in shoes even in snowy weather. The lady said wasn't I cold and I replied that at the most I only wore a blouse and skirt even in winter. She explained even though she was only in her mid 30's (just older than me) she could not go without good foundation wear and tights in the winter. She said I had a very good figure, did I ever wear support underwear. I repeated to her I didn't wear any underwear even with my micro skirts. My friend giggled and the lady did not beleive me so I lifted my skirt to reavel I had nothing on under my skirt. She asked if I could be tempted to wear underwear and I said never.</p>

<p>What do you wear when you go shopping?</p>

<p>Hello Helen</p>

<p>Glad you are OK now. I very much enjoy playing in the snow and know i have to make most of opportunity before it melt. I really not find it too cold and prefer completely naked although sometimes i feel a little ashamed. Most people not bother, they realise i am naked to play in snow rather than just to show off p*ssy. 
I not now wear any top, it for best because i always get hot and take off and have to carry it around and no shoes either!</p>

<p>Do Marks &amp; Spencer sell g string now? When i first come to UK they only have thong, it big and not very sexy. I not know what support underwear is, i guess it like granny pants?</p>

<p>Did you enjoy snow too Helen?</p>

<p>Hi Pilar,</p>

<p>Do you go to the shops topless and what do other shoppers say.</p>

<p>Support undrewear is bras and girdles etc. I have never worn them. I don't own a bra do you? I wear a thong when its that time of month but the rest of the time I am pantyless.</p>

<p>Yes I enjoyed the snow but not bare like you, I wore a skirt and thin to. Though I did go topless on a few occassions its a great feeling to have snow on your bare boobs.</p>

<p>I have not needed to wear shoes this year and now it is warm I don't know how people stand them, there are even some at work with tights on. I have never worn tights as I like my legs bare.</p>

<p>Marks &amp; Spencer do keep g strings but La Stanza are better and smaller.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

Sorry it's been so long , Can't believe how quickly the time goes!
New Year was a bit of a disaster really.  Went down with the dreaded swine flu &amp; was confined to base for a couple of weeks and missed out on the coldest weather.</p>

<p>Still topless &amp; barefoot, micro skirt is more than adequate for me. I love to show what i've got. Perhaps you could go topless more Helen, i know you'd enjoy it.</p>

<p>Go on leave it off tomorrow!</p>

<p>It not a problem to shop topless, i'm  sure you do it sometimes at coast? It no different, people not usually say anything but sometime they stare. I tell one lady i am starting new trend.</p>

<p>I don't have bra since i meet first English boyfriend, he say i not need  it, second boyfriend prefer no panties. Since then i only wear g string if i wear nothing else.
Marks &amp; Spencer seem old fashioned shop. I think assistant have heart attack if she see me and Suzy!</p>

<p>You have to go topless next time Helen and see what she say!</p>

<p>Hi Pilar,</p>

<p>I am sure people in a City like Leeds or York would comment if I went topless into the shops, they give me funny looks because I am barefoot and braless. I got a lot of comments the other day because my top was see through and even more comments when it got wet.</p>

<p>Do you live in a village where people are used to you being completely topless nearly all the time.</p>

<p>I went for an interview for another job last week, I thought I was reasonable covered up but one of the interview panal commented how little I was wearing. I had a blouse and skirt on, admittedly I was barefoot but that is what I normally wear to work. What do you wear when you go for a job interview?</p>

<p>I am fed up of getting wet are you? I wish the drier weather would come.</p>

<p>E-mail me soon.</p>

<p>Hello Helen</p>

<p>I don't have e mail address for you , so i reply here as usual.
I live in a small town and yes obviously people are used to see me completely topless as i wear no top and certainly would not wear one in City either.
The weather so hot now other girls have tops off in town centre too hopefully you have yours off now ?  It really is too hot to cover puppies.</p>

<p>As I said before i don't have a regular job but i do a little casual work occasionally.
Boyfriend has good job so i don't really need to work. In  August i go apple picking at a farm a few miles from town, obviously this is topless. Students from Eastern Europe work there too in summer and they not wear top either.</p>

<p>If i had a job interview i suppose it would depend how much i needed the job as to whether i am prepared to wear top. I guess i would stand out from the other applicants by not wearing one which may be good thing. i think lot of men would employ topless girl.</p>

<p>Of course people will comment if you wear no top Helen but you only listen to nice ones and forget rest. You probably find comments no worse than you get now. Just smile and stick chest out a little further.
Perhaps you try shop topless in local town and soon you have enough confidence to go topless in city too!
Remember i have to walk through town completely nude several times when i play in snow at the park in the winter, so i don't see you having problem just topless in
hot weather.</p>

<p>Let me know what you wearing now?</p>

<p>Pilar. </p>

<p>P.S Did you get job?</p>

<p>Hi Helen</p>

<p>It's fine to go topless in Town, far too hot to have your t*ts covered. Girls from the local art college are walking around topless in the lunch hour, i had a couple in the shop today buying stuff and of course i shop with nothing on top!
I can't see a problem Helen it's no different to being topless on a night out &amp; i know you prefer to have your t*ts out really! 
I tend to agree with Pilar about the job interview, going topless would certainly make an impression. I think if the interview panel was all guys you'd get the job. The girl with the biggest t*ts usually gets the job anyway.</p>

<p>Go on get them out.

<p>I only wear sandals or flip-flops on bare feet all winter long because my boyfriend wants me to. During the summer he mostly makes me go to school with bare feet. Now I'm normally allowed to wear sandals or flip-flops on my way to school, buthe often makes me take them off inside the school building so I still walk barefoot a lot at school. My toenails are always painted and I wear at least one toering on each foot. When temperatures reach above 10Â°C, my boyfriend also likes to make me go to school wearing only barefoot sandals but no shoes. It's really embarrassing but I love him, so I do it. He also does not like me to wear trousers, so I wear skirts and dresses the whole year round, always without a bra and normally without panties. My pubic hair has to be shaved always and whenever he likes I have to carry objects in my $%!@ or butt at school like pens, markers, small bottles or his cell phone. </p>

<p>Hi, I will like to share some of my stories with you. I used to be the girl who dresses up for the weather but this all changes last year when I have my boyfriend.</p>

<p>One day, my boyfriend mentioned he loves to see me shivering and cold, with goosebumps and blueish skins. He loves to see me with bare arms and legs. He also mentioned buying me a diamond ring if i will wear short sleeves/sleeveless top with mini skirts bare legs for the whole year even in winter. I love my bf so much that even without getting the diamond ring, I will wear just for him even if I gets really cold.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I always dress for the weather, so the first time was extremely cold and I shivered uncontrollably.</p>

<p>It was a cold december night, and we had breaks from uni. My bf asked me out to a restaurant for dinner. I decided to dress in a short sleeves shirt with mini skirts and my converse shoe. So that my arms and my legs are all bare. The temperature that night was -3C. I could feel the cold when I walked from my house to his car and from his car to the restaurant. But it was for a short time so it was ok. During dinner, he mentioned how cute and beautiful I looked. I was very happy with his comments. We finished dinner about 8pm, and my bf suggested going to a beach for a evening walk and some chats. Since we only been dating for about 2 months, but we were both busy with uni stuffs, we thought having some chats will be good idea.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the beach, I could feel the extreme cold on my exposed bare skins once I opened the car door. The beach had some icy breeze and added to the already freezing temperature, it was just too cold for me with what i was wearing. By the time I opened the car door, goosebumps covered my arms and legs right away. Within 10 minutes I started shivering and my skin started turning blueish. When I was talking to my bf, he said my chattering teeth and my shivering made me so cute, and the goosebumps on my skins looked nice. I did not want to disappoint my bf so I decided to tough it out. After 30 mins, we decided to sit down, found a snowy ice cold bench. Due to not walking and direct contact of my skin with the snow, I was really really cold. I was shivering uncontrollably as we talked and getting to know more about each other personal stuffs. By one hour, I was so so so cold that it was hard for me to talk. My bf noticed my extreme shivering and extreme chattering teetch while we were talking. He took off his gloves and put his warm hand over my ice cold goosebumps blueish legs. He was a bit shock at how ice cold my legs were and asked me if I was really really cold. I told him I was but the time we spent together was worth it. He offered his jacket to cover my bare arms and started rubbing my legs with his hand. It made me little bit warmer but not much as I was still very exposed and little clothings but the ways he hugged me and rubbing my legs were nice. After another 2 hours of chats, he could see I was very very cold, and we decided to go home.</p>

<p>Three hours in the cold snowy beach with icy breeze really pushed my body to my limits. I had never shiver so much before and also hav maximum goosebumps possible. I had never had my skins ice cold to touch before. But it was a good experience and some good chats with my bf, despite the coldness. It was worth it.</p>

<p>Hi,
I get it that a lot of guys like us girls to show a lot of bare skin in the winter cold. When I wear very little my skin turns a bit red or blueish after some time and I start to shiver, but I don't care, I have no problems freezing as I feel sexy because skimpy clothes simply look better. From my point, guys do very well have a close look at our goosebumps and shivering muscles, as they show off your slim body ;-) Why would one hide it under thick layers? Only if a girl had something to hide...;-) So I am a bit proud to show my flat stomach and my hip bones, my slim legs, shoulders and arms because I have worked out hard for it. My thin body makes me feel the cold a lot more than an average normal-sized girl. But the message is, hey, look there guys, I am cool enough to tough it out, I like feeling sexy (and thus being cold, hehe)! No matter how much I freeze, I stay outside in minimal summer clothing, even if I get sick, that does not stop me. It is my style! And by the way, my boyfriend likes to see me (and show me off :-)) skimpily dressed, cold and shivering and revealing a lot of skin, too. Last winter he mentioned that he loves it when I deny that I am sick although I am obviously coughing and sneezing, just to be able to still go out skimpily dressed with him. He said he loves it when I go out in the freezing cold, wearing next to nothing and shivering uncontrollably with bluish skin and huge goosebumps despite being sick. He also said that he loves it when I get wet in the freezing rain, such that my nipples protrude the thin material of my wet and almost transparent top, while I try to suppress my uncontrollable shivering, sneezing, and coughing through chattering teeth. Does your boyfriend like you to get wet in the cold rain, also your hair? Of course I am not supposed to towel off then, which I tough out to not disappoint him despite being even colder with dripping wet hair, body, and clothes in the ice cold wind. Of course you feel a lot colder when you are sick, but you get used to it and in the end it is not that big difference. Some guys find my cough and sneezing sexy and offer me a kleenex or buy me a hot coffee g. Sometimes I shock them replying that I would rather have an ice-cream ;-).</p>

<p>Princess, I understand that you do not wear much clothing in the cold either ;-). Your experience going out in just a short shirt and mini skirt on a frosty night is amazing! You must have been the center point of attention. Do you wear any underwear? Stupid question, as this does not fit in with your erotic clothing style. I do not wear any either, just no space left under a lowrise jeans/skirt or a tight-fitting top ;-). Too bad that you took your boyfriend's jacket. You should really have toughed it out with bare arms and legs if you really love him. You would not have been much colder without his jacket anyway. Perhaps you could even have taken something more off to please him, you were at the beach after all, what do you think? What about a dip in the sea, (dressed would have been ok since you hadn't been knowing each other for long)? Will you continue to go out bare-legged in short miniskirts and just tiny skimpy tops without jacket in cold nasty weather? Have you tried to go bare-footed, or at least with bare feet in sandals or flip-flops? Will you reveal a lot of skin even if the sub-zero weather makes you freeze your buns off? I guess that's what guys find very sexy about us!
Did you get sick from going out in minimal clothing? This is a matter of getting used to the cold over time and building up resistance. Do you continue to go out wearing next to nothing in subzero weather when you are sick? Does your boyfriend like that?</p>

<p>Ciao,
Lissy</p>

<p>I have to amend that not only men like to see barely dressed women in the cold - at least some women also do.</p>

<p>My own tolerance towards the cold is somewhat limited. If it's too cold I opt for a longer skirt, pantyhose, even trousers and a jacket or a coat; on the other hand I don't tolerate such clothing on my girlfriend Nicole.</p>

<p>I want her to wear always the least possible amount of clothes - especially in winter! </p>

<p>Bare legs and bare belly are a must that is never discussed. If it's only cold but neither raining nor too windy it's also bare arms and shoulders or a completely backless top.</p>

<p>It's so sexy to see her almost bare in bad weather trying to stand it. She's very sweet and cute and seeing her exposed to the elements makes her look even cuter and sexier.</p>

<p>She really copes well with the cold but she's always trying to challenge me by putting on too much. I then either threaten to punish her or - what has proved to be very effective - I tell her it's OK but I'm soo disapointed...</p>

<p>I really don't know whether my man wants to see me freeze but he just doesn't tolerate it when I wear more than a small top and a micro skirt.
Luckily he likes it when I wear high heels and better still those with platform so I never have to go barefoot. </p>

<p>I am very proud that I got through the winter without ever wearing warm clothes but I don't believe I could have sitten for hours on a icy bench in the snow. When I get too cold we always get into some pub or other place until I warmed up a little. On the other hand there's no way I'd be accepting any additional clothing from anyone. Even if my man offered me something I wouldn't accept it as i know how disappointed he'd be.</p>

<p>Hi Laura,</p>

<p>I also like it when women wear minimal clothing in the cold, especially in winter. Since I am mainly interested in men, I am not particularly looking for a girlfriend, on the other hand, your words about Nicole catch my interest.</p>

<p>May I ask whether she is thin, since I believe that slender women are more susceptible to the cold and thus freezing earlier and shivering harder with blue lips and goosebumps, which I think is really sexy. Does or did she try to loose weight to that effect? How tall is she?</p>

<p>I think it is the contrast between the weather and the clothing that attracts attention, and a girl demonstrates self-confidence and coolness when she sticks to her style, no matter what the circumstances are. Hence, I do not let the cold stop me from wearing what I want and enjoy. Consequently, I do not dress any warmer when I am sick. How does Nicole react to being sick? I hope you do not allow her to cover up in that case. I think it is very sexy and self-confident when a girl keeps her minimal clothing style in the winter cold even when she is coughing and sneezing or caught the flu. The contrast is even bigger and sexier when she is obviously sick and refuses to admit so. She will shiver even more and her teeth will chatter louder when she has a fever, which adds even more to her sweetness and sexiness. Did you try that? I did several times, and I never want to miss it!</p>

<p>You mention that you like to see Nicole almost bare in bad weather trying to stand it. I understand that you love to push her to her limits, and she does not want to disappoint you. How good is her cold endurance, i.e., how long did she stay in which temperature and weather conditions? What did she wear, what did her skin look like, how much and how hard did she shiver/chatter? Could you elaborate on that or share some stories?</p>

<p>You write that Nicole has to bare her arms, shoulders, and back only when it is not raining or windy. I think it does not really matter in wind or rain whether these parts are covered or not, since a thin layer of clothing on your arms, shoulders, or back will not keep you warm. In fact, I think that it looks very sexy when small raindrops gather between the fine hair which stands on end with goosebumps on a girl's shivering cold bluish bare skin (by the way, is she tanned?). And then her skin, her tiny top and hair get wetter and wetter... I love that winter wetlook and enjoy it myself. So what do you think, are you planning on making Nicole wear a backless neckholder top when it is raining and very windy next winter? I guess she will like it, and love to wear it to please you even if it makes her very wet and freezing cold, and you will love it, too. In case she should be reluctant, you could tell her it's OK but you're soo disapointed ;-)</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>OMG, thank you so much for this story. I barely made it through reading it and the other posts on here. I am a male and I go crazy for watching girls shiver, covered in goosebumps and the blueish skin.... ohhhhh man, does that ever do it to me. I also love watching women sneeze too which was mentioned in one of the threads here. I love being cold and shivering myself too. If there is anyone out there that would like to talk about this or share pics and videos, please please please let me know</p>

<p>At my high school, the cheerleaders used to be required to wear their short-skirted cheerleader uniforms to the football games no matter how cold it got!  Bare legs!  I still remember my favorite cheerleader out there wearing her letter sweater, and her skirt was so short that only about an inch of it showed below her letter sweater!  She had the sexiest legs!  (She was the cheerleader captain that year, so she might have been able to change the rules about what to wear to the games, but apparently didn't do so.)</p>

<p>Beginning with my senior year, the girls started wearing sweatpants under their uniforms for those cold-weather games.  :(</p>

<p>I don't really like it to freeze...</p>

<p>I actually prefer the summer.</p>

<p>On the other hand my Man wants me to be as bare as possible always. That's why, if I'm wearing anything it's only just the minimal amount of clothes possible. I only wear tiny tops, ultra mini skirts and high heels - nothing else. It's not always esay to be out there in the cold with hardly any protection at all.</p>

<p>I love to please my Man, that's why I'm doing it but I also enjoy the stares, looks and comments I get. </p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>yes, I have the impression that boys like me the more, the less clothing I wear out in the cold. I am skinny and like to show my slim body, and there are boys that say I am pretty, but I think some boys wouldn't have gone out with me if I had worn warm clothes. It is funny that your man does not like to see you sporting as much bare skin as possible, especially in winter. What do you usually wear on your way to school? Do you shiver much?</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Lissy, I think I read your stories some years ago on a board called "Sexy Outfits" which closed down later. Does your boyfried still like to show off your endurance to cold and also to hunger, especially around friends? Do you have any special situation you had to go through when you were allready ill of having fever? What do you wear these days which are quite cold for our region? What occasions does your friend come up with to keep you outside for a longer period? Any special stories from others are also welcome. Regards, Ferfred</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,</p>

<p>We have more in common that I first thought! :) To answer your question, I wear only my uniform and as there's no one to impress, I don't bother showing off unless to my boyfriend if we're going out. I hadn't used to shiver much until I started to wear minimal clothing in every activity I do. I hate dressing warm. I dno't have a very high opinion of myself due to the fact that I am slightly too thin. I'll still wear crop tops and shorts though, as that's what I like to wear. As I am a girl, I prefer to see boys shivering in the cold, I find it quite inspiring, as I am quite an odd person. 
But, not caring what other people think is a good talent to have, please carry on poating. ~Goblia~</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>I don't like warm clothing either. I think it's uncomfortable and unfashionable. It feels hot and stifling as it clings to my skin. Sheer and skimpy crop tops and short skirts/hot pants look much better than bulky winter jackets and trousers, but only if you are thin. Only when you wear little clothing can people see and admire your slim figure, but not when it's buried under bulky layers of fabric. I think it's weird that you are unhappy with your figure, with so many people being overweight, thin is beautiful! If you have a sexy skinny body, it is quite normal to show a lot of fatless smooth skin and flaunt it, at least I do so. As a girl, it also mainly excites me to watch cold shivering boys, but I sometimes get inspired by scantily clad girls shivering in the cold, too ;-). So I don't think that you are that odd :). I suppose that your uniform includes a short skirt and a (sleeveless?) blouse, otherwise you wouldn't be cold, right? Do you wear underwear? When you wear your crop top and shorts in the cold (how short are your tops and shorts?), do you think you feel the cold more due to not having a protective layer of fat beneath your skin? I think I shiver easier and more since I have lost some more pounds, but I don't mind as the looks I get are much more than a pay-off. From that perspective, I suppose I even like to freeze. Are there any situations or conditions when you cover up?</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred,</p>

<p>when boys go out with me, they often want me to wear skimpy clothes despite cold weather. I think they love to watch whether I can take the cold and how long I am able to brave it. Since I don't eat very much to stay slim, I don't mind if they don't take me out for dinner. If we do not eat at all during a night out, it's okay. I may be hungry, but I have learned to ignore my famine. Some people notice and worry that I don't eat, but since they also admire my skinny body, I tell them that I have to diet to stay slim. Since I have no protection against the weather, I catch a cold quite often during winter, but then again I think it's not more frequent than anybody else. A little cold doesn't make me change my clothing style, so I will wear as little as always, even if I have a fever, because boys would be disappointed if I didn't show bare legs, arms and a lot of bare skin on a date, which I am known to do. Maybe I wear even less or undress a bit to cool down my hot body temperature ;-) Last week I had quite a cough that made my lungs hurt and a fever, but I had a date with a guy I had met some days before. Although I barely knew him, he seemed to be quite nice, so when I woke up that morning with a headache, sniffles and that cough that had worsened considerably since the days before, there was no way canceling the date and make him miserable. But I didn't want to cancel it anyway, on the contrary, I was quite keen on going out that night to have fun after a long working week and feel the fresh cold air on my bare skin. I felt colder than usual, the well-known shivery feeling when you develop a fever. When he picked me up that evening, my cold and fever had become full-fledged, and I greeted him with a great sneeze followed by a barking coughing fit. He asked me if we should better cancel the date, but I replied that I was okay and kissed him on the cheek. Despite the cold (-15C and a light breeze), I had put on a sleeveless and midriff-baring black bandeau top and a silver micro-skirt that I wore very low on my hips, way below my hip bones, and that was still barely covering my firm butt cheeks. Nothing else. We went outside and I was shivering immediately, but I didn't cross my arms or legs to cover up, I remained calm, cool, funny, sexy and flirtatious, as a guy would expect from a girl. The longer we walked through the town, the more bluish/reddish my skin got, the bigger my goosebumps got, and the stronger I shivered despite me trying to suppress it for all I was worth, only surpassed by my ever-worsening barking cough. I even asked the guy for a cigarette to stifle my cough a bit. He had to hold me firmly in his arms to light it up, as I was shivering so hard and my blue cold quivering lips had a hard time holding it that I couldn't meet the tip of the trembling cigarette with my lighter. "Gosh are you cold" he exclaimed when he touched my ice-cold bare bluish-red shivering skin covered in huge goosebumps. You could see all my muscles shivering like mad above my slender and long legs, slender arms, rib cage, hip bones, my flat concave tummy, and shoulder blades, as there is hardly any insulating fat beneath my skin. "Aren't you freezing?" I answered, smiling, "Sure! But I don't mind." I barked some hurting coughs again. "You don't want my jacket?" "No, thanks. I can handle the cold. In fact, I am just warm enough. And you would be freezing! Atchie!" "Bless you. Are you hungry?" "No thanks, I have to loose some pounds, don't you think?" "Err..no.." Stinging stare from me "...yes! Your body would be perfect then!" "Thank you!  (Suppressed) Bark, bark, bark" ouch my lungs hurt, but I kept smiling and flirting with him. "You don't sound good." I cleared my sore throat and sneezed again, all the way looking at him, mouth half open, blue quivering lips pouted, erotically batting my eyelashes. "I feel good, especially since I am with you" He blushed. The cigarettes seemed to work, although I had to cough a lot during the first few deep drags. We spent some hours on town, mostly outside strolling from club to club or bar. He had to lend me his hanky multiple times as my runny nose was getting worse as well. I got loads of looks and comments from people, mostly positive about my sexy outfit, some worrying about my health. I just asked the latter if they rather wanted me to be warm and healthy and cover up. No one wanted :)  I could see how my date was more and more turned on by the looks and comments, and so was I! Consequently, we started making out. His hands were all over my bare skin and, as I cold as I was, hot to the touch. We had some really wet french kisses that thawed my almost frozen blue lips, only interrupted by some of my coughs and sneezes. Man did I sneeze. And cough. And shiver. And freeze :) I nearly froze to death but at the same time have never been so alive before! He walked me home in the early morning, and I fell on my bed. Sweet, cold shivering dreams! I think I still shivered when I woke up the next morning :). I enjoyed that night very much, although I was still feverish when I had to go to work on Monday, but that's no problem for me. Maybe it has to do with me ice skating on Sunday? ;-)</p>

<p>Ferfred, there are many other situations, also when it was very cold, but I can't tell them all here :-) What do you want to know specifically? Boys often seemingly love to"test" how long I can survive outside in the cold wearing next to nothing, by, e.g., choosing an outside market, open air concert, or sports event for our date. Some even like to make snow sports with me, as mentioned above. It is an unspoken rule for me to wear, as always, my usual summer attire on these occasions. Otherwise I think boys wouldn't ask me out on a date that often. Likewise, it is not an option to cover up when I really freeze after some hours. But I don't have any additional clothes with me anyway.</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>I like your story ;) Sounds fun! Yes, my uniform does cnsist of a short skirt and sleevless blouse. Once, in a PE lesson, my hands and fingers went slightly blue. And I once dressed in leggings and a vest top on a rainy cold-ish day and I wondered why I felt so cold, as I was wearing more than usual. I mostly get really cold at night. Although, I'd like to see my lips turn blue and like to shiver more than I ever have before, as I do not shiver much, for some reason. Got any tips on how to get blue lips and shiver more?? </p>

<p>Hi Lissy, thanks for sharing your stories. I am sure, others as well as myself like to read more, maybe also about your ice skating.
You seem to be very proud of your slim figure. Could you tell us your height and weigth? Do you have any self-imposed diet and training rules?
How much do you eat before when having a date at night? When you are invited for dinner, what do you eat in the restaurant?
When you come home after such a shivering-tour, do you have any routine to warm up again, like having a hot bath / shower, jumping into a warm bed, or do you exspect from yourself to avoid anything special?
Have you been around with friends for more than a day being watched 24h which you wanted to impress with your stamina against cold and how little you eat and how much you train yourself?
OK, lots of questions. But maybe you like to answer one or the other.</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>in addition to Callen's suggestions you could also fill your shorts with some crushed ice. Have you tried ice cubes? You could push a number of them gently into your most private part before putting on your shorts to cool you down from the inside. How many cubes can you take? For shiny blue quivering lips and sexy chattering teeth, I recommend refilling your mouth with ice whenever you feel hot. And most important: Don't wear shoes, go barefoot. You'll loose a good part of your body heat when your feet are constantly in touch with the icy ground and thus freezing cold. What did you wear (or not wear :)) outside during the cold days and nights?</p>

<p>Hi Joyce,</p>

<p>since my skin is always very cold to the touch you would certainly feel my ice-cold goosebumps and hard nipples when you hold me tight. I could either let loose and shiver uncontrollably or try to suppress my shivering as long as I can, which would you prefer? Perhaps I would have to cough and sneeze, should I try to suppress my cold symptoms as well or do you like it when I am a bit under the weather and feverish, but wearing only a very sexy nothing in the dead of winter for you?</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred,</p>

<p>well, perhaps I'll find time to write some more. As you can imagine, I really like to go out, which I often do, so I am quite happy when a guy asks me out. However, since I'm not at home and writing then... You are right, I'm looking carefully after my figure. I don't eat very much and rather drink water, coffee or tea, which you could call some kind of diet, but I don't follow any classic dieting rules. I work out, though, mostly swimming in the lake (all year, of course). But just for burning calories, because I don't want to grow muscles and want my body to stay clearly feminine. Since I am very slim with a slender frame and rather tall  for a woman at a bit less than 1.80m (5'11''), my weight is below 90 lbs. I don't want to be more specific :). Some people might think I could be underweight, but I am not since I feel great and fit and really like my body. And most guys like what they see and feel, at least I haven't heard of any complaints :). I don't eat before having a date, because we are supposed to have dinner during the date :) But it's also fine if it turns out that we don't eat at all, because there's no time left, we change our plans, or have better things to do :). On most of my dates, we only have some drinks anyway. If I am invited, I don't eat much because I don't want to take advantage of the boy who pays, maybe a salad or an appetizer. I don't do anything special to warm up after a freezing night out, just take a cold shower, or, time permitting, a cold bath (which feels warm when I am cold, a hot shower would boil me!), then lie on my bed and shiver :) Well, sometimes a guy does his best to warm me up again. Certainly I don't mind to lend him a hand, then :) By the way, I sleep in the nude, window open, without blankets, because I easily get hot at night  and don't like clinging, stifling pyjamas or covers. And, it toughens me up a bit of course. I have been with friends for more than a day  multiple times, who could have watched me 24h theoretically, which they didn't because we all slept at night (at least I suppose so). E.g., we spent together a weekend in a skiing resort. Although we did some skiing, we went there primarily for the after ski parties, and as you might already guess, I never brought a jacket, scarf, hat, mittens, trousers, vest, sweater or longsleeve for skiing and even less so for the party nights. Especially the way back to our hotel in the early morning hours was quite cold and I shivered immediately we left the bar, but I didn't cover up or urged my friends to hurry up. I stayed a few feet behind the group with one of my friends and watched the beautiful stars shining bright in the moonlit sky in that crisp and clear night. He asked if I wasn't cold and offered me his jacket. I cleared my throat that had been itching since around noon and replied through chattering teeth that I was indeed very cold but that I didn't care and there was no reason to dress warmer, unless he didn't like what he saw. You imagine his bewildered reaction :) I stifled a cough and my nose started tingling slightly. I knew that I was getting a cold, which I might have caught in the icy head winds on the slopes that were assisted by a steady stiff easterly breeze. Being not the best at skiing (we went there to party in the first place :)), I had tumbled into the snow several times, wetting myself completely, including my dripping wet hair that was already frozen at the ends. My sheer short top had become soaking wet and transparent, exposing a good part of my breasts, my rock-hard aroused nipples poking through the thin fabric. My shorts felt like an ice cold sponge on my freezing soft skin that was covered in huge bluish goosebumps, but the icy wet fabric between my slender legs made my hard, big $%!@ tingling with heat. You can imagine how cold in the wind and at the same time hot and wound-up I was! I could no longer suppress my ever-intensifying shivering and moaned quietly as a shudder that originated from my most sensitive parts gripped me. The shudder quickly evolved into a whole body convulsion before I could regain control of my muscles. That is, until am explosive sneeze followed by the first coughing fit of my developing cold made my body nearly tumble again. I hardly kept my balance. I knew that I would soon be very ill with fever if I continued to stay outside, wet in next to nothing in the sharp frost, but I was so aroused that I just toughed it out and enjoyed, as always. It was simply out of question to dress warmer and ruin my look, go inside, or even cross my arms for warmth, and I didn't waste a thought. For the time being, the cold air stroking my bare wet skin kept my body temperature down so that my fever wouldn't get too high. When I had to cough again I asked my friend for a cigarette, which in addition to deadening my cough numbs my stomachic nerves and helps me ignore my undue sensation of hunger. I smoked half a pack with passion taking deep drags, trying to subdue coughing and sneezing by closing my chattering mouth and tensioning my shivering muscles, while I felt my wet shorts between my legs rubbing me higher and higher as I get colder and colder. Finally, when we arrived at the hotel, my wet clothes were steaming in the cold night air and my breath came out in clouds when I was coughing or sneezing, both clearly visible against the moonlight.</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Joyce,</p>

<p>--First I am a female, I like to watch girls being cold, but male shivering is kind of disgusting for me, coz man should be strong not weak! Plus I am straight! lol</p>

<p>We have something in common there! I am mainly straight, so I like boys, but you have a point in saying that they should be strong. I don't mind if a man shivers a bit as long as he tries to suppress it as long as he can, but he must not complain about being cold. "Mainly straight" means that I also find it inspiring to watch slim girls shivering in the cold, wearing too little for the sake of looking good. However, it destroys the magic for me if they don't tough it out and cover up.</p>

<p>--Second, If i were a man, I wish to see you being in the cold with goosebumps and shivering, but at the same time I will worry about your health, sort of complicate emotions! XP </p>

<p>It is very kind of you that you worry about my health and I really appreciate that, but there's no reason for worries. Many people who see me for the first time ask me if I don't catch my death, but if they get to know me better they get used to my clothing style and no longer bother. When I am ill, I don't let this spoil my day. I want to have fun and go out in the cold rain or snow nevertheless, wearing the same attire as usual. I am so high on adrenaline then that I don't feel the cold, my hurting chest, or headache that much, so there's no reason for covering up. In fact, I think that exposing my body to the winter weather and being cold and shivering helps to bring down my fever.</p>

<p>--So if I were a guy I wish to warm you by putting my arms around your shoulder and hug you tightly! And "keep you warm" tho it doesn't really help!</p>

<p>And if you were (are :-)) a girl?</p>

<p>--Third, I guess the reason of your death must be freeze to death, as it seems you really love the cold no matter what!</p>

<p>I don't hope so :) Although I admit that I have been close to hypothermia or perhaps could have been mildly hypothermic several times. I guess this is what a girl has to endure for beauty, and I'm up for it. Real beauty knows no pain!</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>I don't follow any special plan, I just try to eat not that much. Hence, I don't eat between meals, no sweets, no soft drinks. I have a cup or two of black coffee or tea without milk for breakfast, followed by a small salad or some fruit for lunch (e.g., a mandarine,  water melon, grape, or lemon, but beware of high-calorie fruit like bananas, apricots, or even raisins!). When I have a lot of work to get done, it is common for me to skip lunch and work during the lunch break. Be sure to drink at least six pints during the day to keep you stomach filled. To this end, I also drink black coffee or water. Whenever you are hungry, drink instead of eating. For tea I have - tea! Again without milk, and beware of sweet biscuits (cookies :)). Ok, maybe one sugar-free low-fat biscuit. My next and final meal for the day is dinner, which consists of a salad with vinegar dressing (no oil!) and a big glass of water, or maybe a glass of red wine on saturday. In addition, you should work out, but no strength training as this would only grow your muscles, you don't want to look like a body builder do you. A final advice: Be shivering cold, I mean really freezing cold with bluish skin and goosebumps all over, always. Wear as little as possible and stay wet all the time, including your clothes  and hair. This keeps your metabolism up as your body burns a lot of calories trying to stay warm and keep its core temperature at 37C (or more when you have a fever :)). What does your body look like? Do you like to show off your thin long legs and arms, thin waist, flat tummy, rib cage, shivering hip bones and shoulder blades in a sleeveless, bare-legged, and bare midriff low-rise attire? If you want to loose some more weight for a really sexy slim figure, burn more calories by bringing your core body temperature below 37C. The adrenaline that rushes your body when you freeze very badly in next to nothing feels really good :), especially with all the looks you get for your scantily clad sexy super thin bony killer body. Thus, swimming in cold water, maybe in the sea or a lake nearby, is an appropriate workout. Don't be afraid of hypothermia, just stay in the water when you feel that you can no longer suppress or control your shivering, it'll get weaker again. Leave the water only when your shivering ceases. When you warm up afterwards, you'll start to shiver again, which is normal, because your metabolism ramps up again raising your temperature, and burning all those nasty calories.</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

  <p>1-2 cups of coffee, black                  = breakfast
  small salad or fruit or nothing          = lunch
  salad, even without oil                    = dinner</p>


<p>everyone can live and die like they want, have a diet that makes them stay anorexic and go out freezing and hypothermic if they are ill and invite kidney and lung problems.</p>

<p>but this is not advice to give a girl that is still in school and growing.</p>

<p>if someone is healthy, not ill and feverish, an hour of shivering will do no harm. but to be constantly cold and on the brink of hypothermia is a total other kettle of fish.</p>

<p>also, if someone is doing sports and avoiding too much sugar, you can eat healthy and normal, with lots of fruit, even raisins, and vegetables without worrying about calories. avoid too much chemicals in your food, which means no industry food, cook and season yourself and if you can't, go learn it, that way you eat cheaper and more healthy.</p>

<p>bathing in cold water aka ice bathing <em>is</em> healthy, go look at youtube vids about that. but - those swimmers don't stay in until they are shivering uncontrollably. </p>

<p>if you just want to make yourself shiver - that actually works in water the temp. of 20 degrees. if you sit in it and don't move, you will shiver.</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>I live in Germany. Well, how I react to a guy's hug depends on how much I like him. I don't exactly mind being hugged or embraced, but not for warmth :). A pair of arms around you doesn't really warm you up either. So I might snuggle up to a guy because I like to feel his literally hot body burning on my bare skin. But finally I will get too hot, so I'll have to take something off, or, if that's not possible, break loose of his grip ;). </p>

<p>-- Also: I am rather thin, almost underweight, but I don't shiver very much and don't usually feel the cold. Have you got any tips for me? bare in mind that I go to school still. </p>

<p>What difference does it make that you go to school? Could you elaborate on that? You surely have a beautiful slim figure that you can be proud of. So it should be no problem for you to wear skimpy clothes and be confident. As I mentioned before, cool yourself from the inside (cold drinks, water ice :)) and outside (keep your body and hair wet including your clothes, wet look is cool!). Hasn't it been cold enough lately where you live (where? :)) for you to shiver a bit? You must be quite tough :) Please tell me more about your clothing habits.</p>

<p>--And also, is milk ok to drink, as I can't drink water, [[ It makes me wanna heave D: ]] ???</p>

<p>Lolz! Of course you may drink milk if you don't like water, but I'd prefer low-fat mik in that case, and don't drink too much of it either. Just ensure that your drinks contain as little fat and sugar as possible. What do you usually drink? </p>

<p>I would want to hold and hug you, too, that's quite a normal reaction to someone you're kind of attracted to being cold. However, I don't really suffer, I rather enjoy the reaction of my body to the cold and the rush of adrenaline in my veins. Plus the looks, comments, and invitations/asking out, of course ;)</p>

<p>Hi Lissy, thanks for your reports and comments. When I asked you about staying with friends I thought about occasions where they can watch you around the clock. So maybe not in a hotel where you have your own room but an apartment or youth hostel style or a camping trip. This way they can follow what you eat and drink, if you take cold or hot showers / bathes, if you cover up at night.
Did you ever have a friend who is encouraging you in your life style?
How is your daily routine with sports (swimming) and work? Can you tell us something about your job and what you usually wear at work?</p>

<p>I try to swim at least three times a week or more if time permits, before or after work.</p>

<p>-- Can you tell us something about your job and what you usually wear at work?</p>

<p>I work as a field representative, so clothing is no issue when I travel. Customers also don't mind if I look female, so short blouses and medium length to short skirts and sandals would be my attire. In the office, my boss is a little picky about dressing but I still get away with short skirts and blouses or sleeveless vests. For rare meetings with executive staff I am required to wear a suit, though. </p>

<p>Love, Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,</p>

<p>if you are around your friends in a studio (or similar) do you try to impress then even more like eating very little for the whole time, training more than usual or taking only ice cold showers etc.? Do you as well sleep in the nude without cover? How do your friends (male / female) react? Do they even challenge you to go on?</p>

<p>When asking for friends who are encouraging you I though about someone who is not only commenting on what you do but challenges you to go further. Let's say who ask you to stay longer in the cold in a given situation, who asks you to train even more, or prefers if you eat less in general or for a special occasion?</p>

<p>How do you travel in your job as field representative, by car, train, plane? Are these usually one day trips or do you stay overnight? Do you have good occasions to show your stamina against cold temperatures during you appointments or travels?</p>

<p>--if you are around your friends in a studio (or similar) do you try to impress then even more like eating very little for the whole time, training more than usual or taking only ice cold showers etc.? </p>

<p>No, not really, I behave as usual.</p>

<p>--Do you as well sleep in the nude without cover? </p>

<p>Yes, if my friends don't mind, and usually they don't ;). </p>

<p>--How do your friends (male / female) react? Do they even challenge you to go on?</p>

<p>Friends who have been knowing me for longer don't actually react any more, since they know my preferences and are used to my clothing style. However, people who meet me for the first time are anything from baffled to worried or even seemingly oblivious. If a guy is attracted to me he obviously likes my style, and hence often kind of encourages me. An example would be a guy asking me to wear for a date the same microdress that I wore the week before, although the night this week is much colder. You could as well call it a challenge, because if I like the guy I don't want to disappoint him and I'll wear that dress although I know that I'll freeze my buns off. </p>

<p>--When asking for friends who are encouraging you I though about someone who is not only commenting on what you do but challenges you to go further. Let's say who ask you to stay longer in the cold in a given situation, </p>

<p>Yes, see above. Another such situation would be a night out on town, and somebody spontaneously proposed to walk to that cool club on the other side of town, which hadn't been originally planned. "You sure don't mind, Lissy, do you? You've been looking cold, I mean hot for the whole evening anyway." Keen observer, I'm cold as Antarctica, but guess how I react :)</p>

<p>--who asks you to train even more, or prefers if you eat less in general or for a special occasion?</p>

<p>Rather not. Except for, maybe, a boyfriend who was very much into my slender figure. <br />
He took care of my work out schedule and tightened my diet accordingly. </p>

<p>--How do you travel in your job as field representative, by car, train, plane?</p>

<p>All three. </p>

<p>--Are these usually one day trips or do you stay overnight?</p>

<p>Both, approx. 70-30 in favor of one day trips.</p>

<p>--Do you have good occasions to show your stamina against cold temperatures during you appointments or travels?</p>

<p>Well, primarily I have to do my work, which takes place mostly inside some costumer's or partner's building. When we go out for dinner after work, the evening air is sometimes quite cold, especially in winter. Since I do not cover up then, some of my business partners wonder how I can survive, the women tend to react with indifference or envy, even some admiration, while the males unsurprisingly are much cheekier and also admiring ;)</p>

<p>Love, Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>you are welcome ;). It's good to hear that you enjoy your first real shivering experiences! What did you wear on that occasion? It's no problem that you didn't get ill at the first go ;). Have fun and keep on flaunting :)</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>is it your goal to get ill or is it your goal to shiver? In my experience, if you are healthy to start with, shivering doesn't get you ill. A cold is a result of a virus, not the cold. The cold becomes a problem for your health if you're letting yourself get hypothermic. But as long as you shiver - that is no problem. Hypothermia starts when you are so cold that your body can't shiver anymore. So when you stop shivering, that is, when you have to worry. A healthy body can shiver for hours, even days. But constant cold will weaken your body, so then you might get a virus, because your body has no energy left to fight it. </p>

<p>Also, your thinking processes slow down way before you become hypothermic. There are videos of tests, where someone after even shivering uncontrollably for half an hour, needs more time to do some simple math.</p>

<p>There are lots of videos on the net about hypothermia. Knowing what you're doing is the best to prevent true damage to your health. For example: google dr. popsicle from kanada :-)</p>

<p>So: if you go out shivering for the fun of it, it won't be a problem. If you are ill, have a cold to start with, it is possible to get worse, inflammation of the lung for example. My advice: don't do the shivering thing when you are ill. When you are healthy, there is no harm in going out and shiver. </p>

<p>One more thing: shivering uncontrollably also makes you react very slow physically on top of the slow thinking, so it might be a good idea to have someone with you, who can help you if you let yourself become too cold. </p>

<p>Then the shivering can truly be fun for you and maybe someone, who is with you and enjoys watching and feeling the shivering.</p>

<p>this might not be the right place to talk about this. the topic is changing from cold for beauty to cold for pleasure. you could contact me in private if you want. </p>

<p>If not, just go to youtube, there are lots of vids on how to do icebathing, and hypothermia from dr. giesbrecht (dr. popsicle). </p>

<p>as I said, just for the pleasure of shivering you don't neet to go to extremes (only if you want to). for example: sit/stand in cold water in shower or bathtub or stand outside in the cold without moving for 10 min., maybe drink something cold too,  then go inside for 10 min., drink something hot, then go outside again, the changing confuses your body, you'll get cold a lot faster. </p>

<p>or stand outside in weather 3 to 12 degrees, light clothing or bikini, spray yourself with some cold water, stand relaxed without moving, you'll shiver.
if it's colder than 0 degrees, you'll not need water. drink something hot or cold while standing outside, you'll shiver. if there's wind (or you have a fan) you'll shiver even faster.</p>

<p>How can you tighten your diet even more? You must be quite hungry the whole day with your diet right now. Probably your stomach is noisy regularly. What did he want you to do and how was his encouragement and support for diet and doing sports?</p>

<p>Of course, most of us have to concentrate on our work during the week. But for sure you already had some interesting situations worthwhile reporting here. :-) </p>

<p>For sure people will notice that you eat very little and drink a lot against your hunger pains especially when you have longer meetings and are invited for lunch and / or dinner.</p>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>

<p>--How can you tighten your diet even more? You must be quite hungry the whole day with your diet right now. Probably your stomach is noisy regularly.</p>

<p>Not really. You quickly get used to a diet.</p>

<p>--What did he want you to do and how was his encouragement and support for diet and doing sports?</p>

<p>Nothing special. He was very much interested in my work out and eating habits, just like you ;-). For example, he started to set up sports and diet schedules that I was supposed to follow. That was the point when his involvement was getting a bit too much for me since I only follow my own rules, if anything.</p>

<p>--For sure people will notice that you eat very little and drink a lot against your hunger pains especially when you have longer meetings and are invited for lunch and / or dinner.</p>

<p>Well, maybe or maybe not. But that's the way I live, and not all people are that much interested in those around them after all, at least they don't comment on everything. I feel healthy don't suffer any hunger pains as long as I drink enough.</p>

Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Lissy, 
of course I am interested in your habits ;-) I once read or heard that people who are already really slim also reduce the amount they drink for special occasions because it will bulge their stomach. Do you also drink less when you have a date?</p>

<p>Do you prefer to avoid situations where people eat or do you don't mind being around others who have a nice dinner? You wrote before that you have usually a salad or a starter when you are invited for dinner. Modern restaurants usually have big and delicious salads as main course. Do you choose those or just a side salad without a dressing?</p>

<p>Let's go back to the main theme of this thread: We had some really cold weeks this winter here in Germany? Did you have any special situations in this time? Did you check your limits? Did you go for your usual swimming routing and what did you wear?</p>

<p>Regards,
Fred</p>

<p>Sure! Well, once I sliced the bottom of my foot open very deeply, there was alot of blood and it was extremly painful, though I didn't cry and didn't complain, not even when the nurse squeeezed the sides of the open wound together and stitched them up. </p>

<p>I also went to the Deathy Hallows Part 2 Premier and it rained practically all day, I was wearing a short, black dress and no socks with my flimsy ballet flats. I was absolutly freezing! But I didn't complain to my dad or anyone else.</p>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>

<p>--Do you also drink less when you have a date?</p>

<p>I don't drink so much that it would bulge my stomach ;-) However, regardless of how much you eat, you have to drink enough to keep your electrolytes balanced and your kidneys happy. Hence, my stomach might not be as flat or concave as it could be when I have drunk, but I think you would hardly notice. </p>

<p>--Do you prefer to avoid situations where people eat or do you don't mind being around others who have a nice dinner? </p>

<p>I don't mind if people have dinner around me, certainly everybody may eat as much as they want ;-) Likewise they don't mind my eating habits, I think most of them don't even notice.</p>

<p>--Do you choose those or just a side salad without a dressing?</p>

<p>Depends on how hungry I am, but I never eat until I am literally full. Basically I like all kinds of salads if they're made without oil or meat. For me, salads mustn't be drowned in dressings of any kind, either.</p>

<p>--Did you have any special situations in this time? </p>

<p>I don't know what you consider "special" ;-). Since I always go out dressed rather skimpily, I don't think this is special for me. During the cold spell I wore pretty much the same as always, short (mini-)skirt or hot pants and short sleeveless tops, for example. I also smoked a cigarette or two outside as usual during breaks, without covering up. When I went out for the night, I stayed outside as usual walking through the city or between clubs. I attended some outdoor events (sports, concerts) as well, and did some ice skating and cross-country skiing as I mentioned before. I was very cold and could not always control my shivering. In fact, I shivered a lot and at times even my teeth chattered, but I tried my best to hide it. People seemed to contemplate my clothing style a bit more than usual given the very low temperatures. On the other hand, I received even more compliments ;-).</p>

<p>--Did you go for your usual swimming routing and what did you wear?</p>

<p>Yes I did, because I want to stay fit. Well, what do you wear when you go for a swim, not much I think ;-). If people are around for a stroll or walking the dog at "my" lake, I wear a string bikini, which I sometimes shed when I'm in the water or they're at a safe distance or don't mind to see a lady in her birthday costume. If I'm alone I prefer to skinny-dip anyway.</p>

<p>Love, Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Goblia,</p>

<p>--And also, Lissy, if a man puts his jacket on you, do you hand it back to them or keep it??</p>

<p>Since a jacket will almost always ruin my outfit <em>g</em>, I politely refuse his offer and give it back to him. After all, the reason to walk around in skimpy clothes despite the cold is to  brave the elements and show your body, isn't it? If the guy is nice, I offer him to join me for a drink, though. ;-)
Do you wear a jacket when you're offered one? How do you react? Do you ever wear a jacket, e.g., when you are ill?</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>When you eat very little regularly and even don't eat the full day when you know you are going out for "dinner" I propose you are always quite hungry. Of course, you will tell everyone that you are not and also want to make us believe you are not ;-) The fact that you prefer salad without oil, meat and only little dressing is this because you really don't lilke the taste or just to make sure you keep your slim figure?</p>

<p>If you bring a string bikiny for swimming how to you get there and what are you wearing? Do you bring a towel or something to warm up afterwards? Did you ever had a spectator wating for you to come out of the water?</p>

<p>These days many bars have seats already outside as smoking is not allowed inside. Usually people willl stay only outside while smoking and still wearing thick clothes and wrapped in blankets. Have you ever been asked to stay outside a bar / restaurant (without a gas heater around) for a longer period. I suppose it would be quite demanding to not show the freezing when you are supposed to stay still.</p>

<p>Anyway wearing so little is sexy also in summer time? Do you also think about this in winter or do you concentrate on not shivering too much. Do you show of what you wear under your tops and skirts?</p>

<p>Fred</p>

<p>Hi Globia,</p>

<p>Hi winter lovers,</p>

<p>You should live in eastern Canada (e.g. Quebec province), here you can enjoy real dry &amp; white winters!</p>

<p>I live in Montreal and for us 0C is not considered as cold (not warm either, just between both): you can still see some people going with bare legs in the streets.</p>

<p>When temperatures drop below -10 or -15C there are only a few who go bare legged (except girls for clubbing), however you might still meet a few in -20 or -25C weather (both genders, females in skirt and males in shorts) (such cold days are not that frequent in Montreal).</p>

<p>Search for "Montreal winter bare legs" or "Montreal winter bare legs Igloofest" in Gooogle Images (Igloofest is an outdoor festival in January; despite the -20 or -30C temperatures with wind chill, there are some people who remain outdoor bare legged or topless all night long!).</p>

<p>Personally my limit of comfort is -20C to go bare legged and -10C to go barefoot i.e. shoeless (with a limit of 1 or 2 hours if there is some snow in the ground). I'm not a 24/7 barefooter but I enjoy to do so even in winter (I've only met two other winter barefooters in Montreal).</p>

<p>I used to have some great experience while I was in UK, but moving back to HK made me lack of experience, I use to love to keep the windows open without heater, no matter how cold it is, and i will put on only bareback tops and shorts, but somehow i could not let myself shivering for the whole day, or my muscles will get too stress. Plus coz i was living in a boarding school and with my host family, i cannot dress too little while i leave my room. In HK i am living with my family, so i could not dress too less either, as my family is quite a traditional one. </p>

<p>I am a fan of seeing girls shivering tho, I visit the chilly girl blog a lot, but dun have an account, but successfully found some around the internet. Not a fan on seeing boys to shiver tho, I guess Lissy will do so well, if she could be one of their models.  </p>

<p>I had this experience back to last winter, I am studying art, so we decided to make videos for our joint exhibition, and I have to dressed minimally to have some shoots done. It was 8 to 9 C, so it was actually not freezing for me tho, it is just slightly cool for me, but my friends could not believe I can stay warm in my string tank top for the whole shooting day and said, "How can u dressed such little, I am freezing even with my jacket on" lol </p>

<p>Sorry i dun have the video with me. I wish i may experiment with hong kong's chilly weather more in the coming winter, but it is hard to find real cold winter in HK now.</p>

<p>We use to have fire drill while I was in the boarding school in UK, it could happened in any time. Once i was in a shower and the fire alarm went on, I quickly put on my backless tank top and my really short short. it was -2c with light rain, we got to stood outdoor until the fire fighters arrive, as it was not a drill, I stood there for like 2-3 hours, unbelievably i was not shivering neither having big goosebumps, I got very light goosebumps on my arm, but my nipple got so hard. </p>

<p>I really miss these experience! Unluckily I am now in HK. I used to wide open my room windows in UK, the room was so cold that I can see my own breath, all I am wearing is tank top/ tube top with shorts! It was so wonderful, different from lissy and shiver's girl friend, I enjoy the de-frozen feeling in shower and I cover thick blanket when I am in bed, as I love to have a bit pressure on my body when I go to sleep, that make me feel safe!  </p>

Erm, I dunno really, it shows you have stamina and it's beter than being hot.</p>

<p>When I was walking back from a pub on holiday in a little dress and it was rainy and windy, not sure when I was the coldest, but I was pretty cold then. ;) I got a few looks from a few boys. No sure what they were thinking.</p>

<p><i>zugger do you have any good stories to share?</i></p>

<p>I have to say, I have nothing that could compare by any means with what you are living with Elizabeth. I can't wait to read about the third assignment.</p>

<p>There are some cool stories and experience reports here on MP but I'm pretty sure you already know them all. </p>

<p>As for proper experience: My wife is very sensible for the cold, so she would never do something like that.</p>

<p>The last memorable experience is from this winter: I was traveling in the Swiss Alps. At one point I had to change from one train to another, a very small one. This was at about 2,300m of altitude. You had to walk over snow and ice from the main station to another train line some 150m away. There were two local girls who were totally not dressed for the climate with short skirts and ballerina shoes. Unfortunately both wore (thin) tights. One of them was only wearing a really light jacket. They were chatting quite happily (That's how I learned they were locals) like if it were completely normal to be dressed liked this in the middle of the mountains with 1.50m of snow everywhere. Everyone else was wearing boots, gloves, heavy coats or jackets. </p>

<p>The second train was really old, rather historic, and did hardly have any heating (or none at all, I'm not sure)  but the two girls were absolutely unimpressed. When it reached its destination about 20 minutes later they got out and started walking away (I don't know where to) through the snow.</p>

<p>I do post stories that I find memorable from time to time, but as I said, I've got nothing that compares to yours.</p>

<p>Shiverfan, 
You have many nice stories.
I always try to find models to make a video in the cold, but i find nobody wich is willing to shiver from cold. :-(
One storie from the past i remember. I was on a birthdayparty in February 3 years ago.
I meet a girl there 23 years old. We talked together. After a while we decided to go for walk to be alone. So we leave the party, it was cold this night -4 degrees i think. On a Bridge we stoped to talk. She cam. nearer and nearer, so we start kissing. She only was dressed in a jeans and a tank top. So her arms covered in goosebumps. Her lips shivered very hard, also when we kissed us. I touched her butt and felt that it was shaking too. After 10 min her body shivered uncontrollably, her legs, her butt, also her face. I asked her if we want to go back, but she said"no, i want to be alone with you" so we stand there for about 30 minutes an kissed us. Her shivering slim body was so hot, i loved the Situation with her. After 40 minutes we were back to the party, but the night i will never forget: :-)</p>

<p>Yeah! Still three more days if I'm counting right. I feel a certain pity for poor Elizabeth but after this she'll be the undisputed champion of cold endurers! After that you might consider buying a big fridge, make a hole for air and let her sleep inside - completely naked. Imagine that, at night after having your last sex of the day she steps into the fridge and in the morning after 7 hours at 4C (you could start with higher temperatures like 7-10C for the first weeks) you have a fresh and crispy girlfriend ready to start another exciting day.</p>

<p>I wish Elizabeth's still doing fine, i am glad u got a warm up section, or she must be dying! How people react when they saw her except giving weird looks and shocked looks? Can u wrote the whole situations more details? and more adjectives to comment on the whole experience? like how short is her skirt, how her body react and so on, i like more descriptions! And i promise i will experiment more when it is winter and share more story with u guys, but in the moment, HK is Hot even my A/C is fully on! XDD</p>

<p>Hi Shiverfan,
maybe you can describe your former(?) girlfried Elizabeth some more. What was her figure like, her hair, her appearance.
Did she have to meet other chalenges beside skimpy dresses in winter. How has her dress style in summer? What kind of shoes did she have to wear? Any other rules?
Looking forward to your answers and reports.

I really enjoy all the stories on this thread and it's great to see that so many girls like myself enjoy braving the cold :) I feel like I should share my stories with you guys too!</p>

<p>It all started about 3 years ago when I was 18 and had my first boyfriend. Back then, I dressed like any other typical girl. However, my boyfriend wanted to change this because he really liked to see girls shivering with goosebumps and redish/blueish skin. With my boyfriend around, I started wearing less and less gradually.</p>

<p>During Christmas, my boyfriend gave me a special gift :) When I opened it, I found an extremely thin tank top and a 6-in. micro mini skirt. I loved my boyfriend and when I saw this, I thought of the perfect surprise. I called him and asked him for dinner tonight. I decided to surprise him by wearing nothing outside but what he gave me which was a paper-thin tank top and a very short micro skirt in the middle of winter (I also had high heels on) xD I knew I would be really cold but I decided that I should brave it to impress him. </p>

<p>Because it was the first time I wore so little clothing (although I have worn skirts in the winter prior to this), I was extremely cold and shivered uncontrollably the moment I walked out of my house. The temperature that night was about 10F (-12C). As we walked to the restaurant, I could feel every bit of cold and was covered in huge goosebumps with my nipples sticking up and my skin was turning bluish. I received a lot of looks and we met a friend who was surprised by my new style and asked if I was cold and I told her I was fine. During dinner, my boyfriend told me this was the best surprise he has ever seen, saying how he loved seeing me shiver and cold in minimal clothes and wished I could do this the entire winter. I told him I will grant him his wish and he kissed me in joy. </p>

<p>After dinner, my boyfriend suggested to have a nice walk with me in Central Park. Once again, I was freezing cold and shivering uncontrollably during the entire walk. That night, the wind in Central Park was extremely strong. My teeth soon began to chatter and my boyfriend told me I am the cutest and sexiest girl he has ever known which made me extremely happy. We spent about an hour in Central Park, walking and taking pictures and sitting down having a nice talk in which I was talking with chattering teeth. By this time, I was unbearably cold but I still decided to tough it out because my bf is so awesome. Just to my luck, it started to snow and the snow fell right on my bare arms and legs making me even colder. My tank top and micro skirt were completely wet and my nipples kept poking out of the paper thin fabric of my shirt more and more. My hair also started to form some sort of ice . My boyfriend noticed how cold I must've been and took off his gloves to feel my bare legs. He shivered at the touch of my legs and said I was as cold as the snow. My bf then kinda felt bad and offered me his gloves and jacket to which I denied and said that all I wanted was a long warm hug with him :) We had a good hug which got me a bit warmer. We stayed around in the snow for a bit longer and then decided to take the bus home. People on the bus were shocked to see how little I was wearing when I came on lol</p>

<p>When I got home, it took me almost half an hour to get my hands and feet unnumb. The next day, I started getting sick. Oddly enough, I really enjoyed it and it was a day I'll never forget. In fact, I did not mind being sick, I still wore the least clothes possible and felt the cold even more :) Whenever I feel the cold breeze on my skin and see all the stunned looks, I feel so sexy xD </p>

<p>Last year, I decided to clean out my wardrobe and get rid of/donate all my jackets and jeans and basically anything other than thin tank tops, short dresses, mini-skirts, and short shorts/hot pants so I wouldn't have the temptation of warm clothes in the winter. My boyfriend is living with me now and he was extremely happy to see me do that :) I was able to go the entire winter with minimal clothing, even when it was snowing, all I could wear outside was a tank top and mini-skirt. Sure, my body did get really cold but I enjoyed every second of it! I am really looking forward to this winter as the summer is too hot even with minimal clothes.</p>

<p>@shiverfan: I really like your stories and how your girlfriend does so many challenges. I'm sure she really enjoys it despite the cold :)</p>

<p>@joyce: hey, I see that you live in HK. I actually have a Chinese cousin who came from HK. He told me that in certain parts of HK, there's no heating unit at all even during the winter. Sounds awesome xD would be fun if you wore minimal clothes and braved the cold the entire day, even in your sleep lol</p>

I'm actually still a college student although I will be graduating soon :) Right now, I have two part time jobs one at a clothing store (which really appreciates the way I dress) and another at a bank which allows workers to wear skirts and sleeveless tops :) I guess I am lucky lol</p>

<p>alright then, I'm curious when you say excitement, do you actually mean the feelings of goosebumps and shivering actually excite you? Do you actually enjoy freezing or why exactly do you go through with it? I'm very impressed by your courage and your willingness, I recall you said you were Korean, I am as well! </p>

Yes, I enjoy the feelings of goosebumps and shivering as well as the reactions I get from others. I enjoy fashion and I think wearing minimal clothes in the winter looks very sexy and fashionable :)</p>

<p>@Chilly: planning to wear minimal clothes the entire winter no matter how low the temperature gets :) My bf thinks I dress less enough, he is completely satisfied lol </p>

<p>gfx, welcome to this forum!</p>

<p>I love your stories and your attitude. It's a bit sad you won't show images, but that's up to you and your bf. Good luck with the winter. Are you wearing really high heels over icy streets? Do you sometimes slip and fall and land on your bare bottom?</p>

<p>shiverfan, I think there is still one more day with Elizabeth. I assume you saved the most extreme challenges for the last day. Will she be able to cope with them? What did she say when everything was over? Was she proud or just happy that it was over?</p>

<p>videos can capture it very well. if you put the video on a tripod and stand before the camera, preferably in profile and not moving too much, then the shivering can be seen and the chattering teeth can be heard. You can see samples of such videos here:</p>

<p>@shiverfan: the coldest I've ever experienced was probably when I went on a trip to Montreal with a couple of friends in the middle of winter. There was one day where it was probably -20C (-10F). The only clothes I brought with me were tank tops, backless dresses, hot pants, and miniskirts. My friends also did not bring any warm clothes. I had no choice but to go bare legs and bare arms in absolutely freezing weather. The moment I walked outside my hotel, I already had huge goosebumps and chattering teeth. We did not walk on the streets for too long but my body was already freezing cold. If I stayed out for any longer, I wouldv'e probably been at risk of hypothermia. However, once again, it was a wonderful experience and I got a lot of nice glances from guys :)</p>

<p>@zugger: thanks :) I usually don't wear really high heels because I am already quite tall (5'10) and it won't look good if I'm taller than my bf who is 6' so I usually wear only 2 in heels.</p>

<p>gfx: I live in the US currently, although I'm originally from Korea. I'm curious as to when you get goosebumps do you usually get them all over, are they more intense on your arms or legs, would you say you have a lot of arm hair to make them stand up more? Thanks for joining this forum, I have always wondered these things but never had the guts to ask anyone. Why do you like the feelings of goosebumps? </p>

<p>@daewongkim: same here. Have you ever been to Korea? I went there one summer and I loved it! I really admire their fashion and culture and not to mention, I love kpop :D</p>

<p>You get goosebumps whenever you feel cold. The size of the goosebumps depends on how cold your body feels. Usually, the coldest parts of your body will get more intense goosebumps. It also had to do with blood supply which is why ppl don't get goosebumps on their face or foot compared to arms and legs. Technically, goosebumps can appear on any part of the body. I am very thin and barely have any arm or leg hair so when I go outside in the winter bare arms and bare legs, I get cold pretty easy and get pretty large goosebumps. I don't really like the feeling of goosebumps, it just helps your body brave the cold :D</p>

<p>wow, that's really interesting! Are there times where you just get goosebumps but don't shiver or times where you're shivering and chattering so hard but your arms are smooth? Or do they usually happen right after another? I love your honesty and your stories! And also how long do goosebumps/intense shivering last for you? Has there ever been a time where you had goosebumps and shivered for like hours straight? You are truly incredible!</p>

<p>no I always get goosebumps and shiver at the same time, they are both responses to the cold although there is a certain temperature where you might get goosebumps but not shiver. I have experienced goosebumps and intense shivering for hours straight, there's no harm to getting goosebumps and shivering at all. And thanks for the compliments :D</p>

<p>"@shiverfan: the coldest I've ever experienced was probably when I went on a trip to Montreal with a couple of friends in the middle of winter. There was one day where it was probably -20C (-10F)."</p>

<p>I live in Montreal and I go bare legged all the time (with a winter coat, hat, gloves, boots). Bare legs in -20C remains very comfy once you get used to it, even for several hours. People's stares are very funny tough - they stare you and feel cold for you, while you just don't feel any cold on your legs.</p>

<p>About the rest of the body, this is another story. Once I remained 45 min outside in -20C weather wearing a thin tee-shirt (plus shorts as usual and winter boots). I was feeling completely fine until I went into a warm place (i.e., the metro) and then felt cold and start shivering for about 15 min.</p>

<p>I tried barefoot a couple of times but the risk is real, although I've been told that a very few barefooters do remain barefoot all the time in Montreal (however I assume they won't stand in the deep snow for 2 hours in -25C blizzard).</p>

<p>So, just curious what is everyone's favorite story of somebody they know that was shivering with goosebumps etc.? </p>

<p>Mine is I had a friend who is always cold but she rarely wore warm clothing, especially when it was summer and air conditioning can be really intense. Well she came to school in a short sundress with her arms and back all exposed and the average temperatures of the room was around 65 degrees. Well she would always come visit me during my English lab which I did online and we would hang out in the room, just the two of us and she froze this particular day. She had goosebumps all over her arms and legs and she would not stop shivering. I personally didn't do anything to make her cold but I couldn't help but feel very excited and happy by the situation and since she is very touchy and affectionate to everyone, spent the entire lab in each other's arms! Fortunately I work fast so I could make up my actual work quite fast! ;)</p>

<p>Hey everyone, ok so following up more in-depth on my question of what is everyone's favorite story, I have a more detailed story about my favorite incident. Again what is everyone's favorite shivering/goosebumps story?</p>

<p>Well mine kind of goes like this:</p>

<p>I am a student and when I was in high school I had an college level English lab I took online through a local university and I would be given time during the school day to work on it. I had a friend who had a free period that same time and since I worked really well and really fast generally I could get a week's worth of work done in a day. However she would come and visit me on a regular basis. She's a beautiful girl with long brown hair and an incredible body, a bit on the more husky set but I feel that her look is perfect for her, and she gets cold SO easily. Several times I remember sitting there next to her and it could be like 80 in the room and she'll be wearing a sweatshirt and all of a sudden she'll shudder from cold and start chattering her teeth. Well for some reason she decided to make her senior year of high school a "less is more" kind of thing. She only wore short dresses and shorts to school and at very least, very short t-shirts, often tank tops even in winter. Often we would be in class and she would be talking to me and she would have goosebumps all over her arms. I think she had goosebumps more often than not that year. When I asked her why she made the wardrobe change she simply replied "I like being sexy is that a problem??" ;) but she said that when she started it was miserable because the goosebumps and chattering teeth drove her crazy at first. She said that it always felt like she had pins in her arms and legs from the constant goosebumps and when it got late at night and colder she would sit in her house shaking violently rubbing her arms for warmth but would never get a coat or blanket. </p>

<p>Well this particular day was unbelievably amazing. I went to English lab and she came in with a sleeveless sun dress, exposing her arms, shoulders, back, and legs. I saw goosebumps immediately before she even got close to me. I asked her if she was cold and she replied "I'm freezing dear" and kissed me on my cheek. She shuddered and rubbed her arms up and down then asked if I would warm her. Her skin was ice cold and every single millimeter of her skin was covered in goosebumps all over. Poor thing, she seemed colder than normal because her teeth were chattering so hard for like 15 straight minutes and I could actually feel her nipples poking through her dress, and when I don't think she could have gotten any colder, she shudders again and more goosebumps come. I asked her if she was ok and she said that she wasn't feel well and was getting chills. She said that it was the kind of cold where "your teeth chatter so hard for so long you're afraid you'll break a tooth." Well I apparently was her hero because I cuddled her the whole period and since i"m always warm to begin with, certainly made her very happy. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my story, please feel free to share your own. Also could you also copy responses to daewongkim@yahoo.com and send any links or photos you have of goosebumps and shivering that would be much appreciated! Thanks everyone!! :)</p>

<p>@daewongkim: your story about the girl in your lab class actually reminds me of myself when I first started dressing minimally :) I used to get cold very easily as well and started dressing less in my high school of senior year when I met my bf lol I remember how shocked my friends were when I started coming to school every day in the winter wearing a tank top and miniskirt and how the adjustment was kinda hard at first. I had a hard time resisting wearing a coat outside when I was sick and falling asleep in a tank top every night without a blanket. But after a while, braving the cold started to get easier and easier and the cold breeze on my arms and legs every morning when I walked to school actually started to feel really good. However, I believe I still feel the cold and get more goosebumps than normal ppl because I am very thin, I just got a lot more used to being cold :)</p>

<p>@laloli: I really like your story, you sound like you enjoyed your job lol</p>

<p>@zugger: at my agency we girls are not allowed to promote on our own but I'll give you a hint: It's about 15km south of Zurich (not at the lake side) and they are promoting heavily.</p>

<p>@bassdrummer: post yours and I'll reply privately. </p>

<p>@shiverfan: This is some stuff I posted some years ago when I was 18 about the story of my life, it's not so much about shivering, more about how it came that I usually wear very little or no clothes at all but, as one thing is the reason for the other, maybe you still find it interesting.  As I'm reading this again, I notice my English was still quite bad then, although I had help with this text:</p>

<p><i>I grew up in a forest area in an old farm house with no other house in sight. My clothing limits started when I was 9. During summer one day I ran around naked all day and I didn't want to put clothes on in the evening. I was already used to sleep naked when it was hot. So I stayed naked for a couple of days. My parents tried to convince me to put some clothes on but I didn't wanted. Then they said I had to decide: either dress decently or not using clothes. So it became the rule that I had to be naked in the house all the time and naked around the house in summer. In winter obviously I could use a jacket or a sweater but stayed bottomless. During period I could use panties. Of course I got dressed for school and when going into town.</i></p>

<p><i>Over the time my parents made the rules tougher, they wanted me to go back to normal clothing, but I always followed the rules, I guess I'm quite rebellious. In the beginning I got dressed when people visited us, but later I wasn't allowed anymore. In the car I could only wear a top or T-Shirt but no skirt or trousers. When I got out of the car I always put something on. I guess my parents would have been ashamed if they were seen with a bottomless girl. In school I had to wear always quite short dresses or skirts. From around 12 on I hardly wore any panties. I was really popular with boys, also the older ones. They all loved the way I dressed. There was no other girl who dared to dress like me. </i></p>

<p><i>I think my parents tried to break my will but didn't succeed. They always thought that at some point I was going to be embarassed or ashamed. The only thing they achieved is that I totally lost my shame of being naked around people. I moved to London four month ago. I share a flat with three guys and they absolutely don't mind if I run around bare or with just a top on - on the contrary: they totally love it. That's really hot. When I was naked with my family it was just comfortable and I liked being different and challenging, but now it's different - I love the looks and comments I get and I love it even more to make the guys hot.
</i></p>

<p>The following is from an email I wrote to a friend (the English is still worse here, nobody corrected it, unlike the message above. I hope you can understand most of it but I don't really feel like rewriting it)</p>

<p><i>
My mom is from Austria and my Dad from Spain. That is where I growed up - in Extremadura.</i></p>

<p><i>There is where I also most times lost my clothes. Natually I had to put on clothes for school. I had tried not to, but I was not allowed.</i></p>

<p><i>To go to school, I had to cross a small forest and walk over some fields to the village. In my school many knew that I was naked at home. One day when I had 11 years 4 boys from the school walked with me over the fields and then asked: "Is it right you are naked at home?" I said "yes" and they asked "Do you like it?" And again I said "Yes, much".</i></p>

<p><i>Then one asked: "If you like it to be naked - why aren't you now?" I asked back, "Many people don't like it. In the school and in the village I can not be naked." One said, "we like it very much, and there is nobody else around here, so why don't you get naked?" I thaught this was a good idea and undressed. They said I looked nice and asked if they should carry my clothes when we were walking. I thaught that was nice, and gave them to them. That was a mistake because they ran off with all my clothes. I ran a bit after them, but they were much faster. They stayed at a short distance so they could watch me, but always when I came nearer to them they ran away a bit more but when I went away they followed me. After a while I gave up and went home. They followed me until I reached home. I didn't have problems with my family. I usually undressed before going into the house. It was a very funny feeling when I walked naked and they watched me. I was very angry that the boys had my clothes but I had a strange feeling in my belly and my $%!@. Now I know I was horny, but then I did not know that.</i></p>

<p><i>The next day in school I talked to the boys because I wanted to have my clothes back. They told me to meet after school just outside the village. When we met they told me I can have my shoes and dress back if I give them my panties. I said OK and took of my panties and we changed things. After that they asked if I wanted to walk with them naked again. I said yes, but I keep my clothes with me. So we walked together this time and I wasn't angry and I had this feeling again,  but stronger.</i></p>

<p><i>At the next morning the boys were waiting on the way near my home. They asked me "are you wearing panties?" I said yes and they said: "Give them now or in the afternoon we will take all your clothes and not give them back." I was afraid of that, because I did not have many clothes and my family would know after a while if a dress was gone, so I did give them my panties. I then had lost two of them. It was very funny in school, to not wear nothing under my dress and nobody knew.</i></p>

<p><i>I met the boys again after school. They did not give me my panties back but still I walked naked with them, but again I keeped my clothes with me.</i></p>

<p><i>The next day it was saturday and then sunday and I was naked all the time. On monday I thaught I will not loose more panties and leaved them at home. When the boys met me they were surprised. I thaught they liked that I was not wearing panties but they had also liked to take things from me, so it was part good part bad for them.</i></p>

<p><i>From then I did not wear panties to school until the end. One day my sister found out and she told my mom. My mom got very angry, and said I must wear panties to school, but I said no. She then said: if you want it like this, we will take all your panties away until you learn that it is not good. But then I said: "no you can'Ât, because I need panties to put pads in when I have my period." So I could keep them and go to school without when I wanted. Much later I knew tampons and that I don'Ât need to wear panties when I have my period, but I need to cut the string a bit then. It's to long for me.</i></p>

<p><i>After the boys took my two panties away we often walked together when I was naked. It was cool, and we became good friends. They were also the first who $%!@ed with me the next year.</i></p>

<p>Thanks Chilly (next piece tomorrow if I find the time), you are too good to me - I haven't got nearly the endurance of shiverfan's former gf. Half an hour in ice water is surely more than I could take. What a woman! Incredible! </p>

<p>Lynne Cox also swam a mile in the Antarctic Ocean. She wrote a book all about her cold water swimming career, called "Swimming to Antarctica". In that there's a great chapter about her discovery that she loved being cold one day at school in the open-air pool during a hailstorm when she was allowed to stay in. All the other kids left the pool but she loved the feeling of the icy hailstones falling on her head and back. She felt they'd all missed something wonderful.</p>

<p>I discovered the same when I was at primary school. The teachers thought I was mad when I took clothes off to go outside at breaks instead of putting on more. It's a feeling I've never lost even four decades later. My friends have sort of got used to it but strangers often comment on how little I wear.</p>

<p>Third half day of my snowy weekend (part I)</p>

<p>After warming up my body felt better but the I felt the cold much more than before and started almost immediately to shiver a bit when we went out. Frank told me then, that now I could do more than the baby hill and could go to the next easiest one. He pointed to a hill on the left. To me it seemed enormous and terribly steep and the people going down looked like total experts to me. He must have noticed my scared look and told me: "It's only 80m high, it's really for absolute beginners. You'll be able to do it." and guided me to the lift.</p>

<p>This time it was like a big fork for two people. You had to stand and when the fork came from behind you had to put it under your bum and it would drag you uphill. I was really happy to have Frank with me. Thank God the fork was plastic and not metal. Still it felt like sitting on ice when it touched my bare legs. Frank said "we will get off in the middle when it gets flat again." About halfway up there was indeed a flat part and he said go. OK, I managed to get off the lift but as I was still in movement I lost control again and fell flat into the snow. As I was really slow, it didn't hurt a lot, but gosh, the snow was cold.</p>

<p>Whilst I was struggling to get up again the next fork with two guys passed. They shouted something like "hey, the beach is over there and pointing in some direction." I wonder what they would have said if I were blond.</p>

<p>Frank helped me up and rubbed the snow from my body, that was nice of him. We looked down the hill. It seemed so, so steep and my heart was beating like crazy - good against the cold. Frank said "follow me" and slid about 10m down. I followed, and yes it worked! But only at first, I did a curve and didn't get it right. I started to go downhill very fast and at a point where it was a bit steeper I was suddenly in the air and fell flat on my belly, I lost my skis and started sliding slowly downwards on my front side with my head first. Everything happened so fast, my bikini bottom was ripped from my body, the knots at both sides had opened, and my top opened behind the neck and it went down to my waist. My poor nipples scratched over the frozen surface as well as my belly and thighs. This was painful, I can assure you.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thoughts ran through my mind: "How stupid can you be to get into this? What if I can't stop? Will my nipples freeze and break (completely idiotic - I know)? Will my skin be ripped off? Frank and everybody will think I'm a total idiot." etc</p>

<p>Suddenly I stopped. Frank was beside me and had grabbed my leg. He helped me turn around and I sat with my completely naked bum in the snow. </p>

<p>I sobbed a little and tried to calm down. Frank examined me whilst I was sitting there sniffing and shivering. After he saw that nothing really bad had happened to me, he asked me whether I wanted to go back to the restaurant or even to the house. I considered a moment, but then I said "no, I'm not the girl who gives up easily". I fixed my bikini top. It had suffered a bit but I still could put it on. My nipples were so hard, that they made an air cushion between skin and fabric around them.</p>

<p>Frank brought me the bikini bottom which was quite OK still. He helped me up and there I stood with shaking legs. I took a few deep breaths, took off my right glove, put it into my bikini bottom and squeezed my $%!@ and smiled at him: "OK, let's go $%!@!". He smiled back and shook his head whilst I put my glove back on "You are unbelievable" he said.</p>

<p>I started to slide down extremely carefully and slowly, Frank always by my side. I only fell once again at the end of the slope, but not like before. I was not that cold at the moment as it had been quite exhausting, yet my whole front side was still hurting somewhat because of the fall before. When we were heading towards the lift again we were stopped by two Italian guys who wanted a photo with me. I stood between them whilst Frank took photos with their mobiles. On the way to the lift he slapped my bum and said "you are really doing great!" I blushed a little, I have always been quite receptacle for compliments and a slap on the bum is also always appreciated. </p>

<p>On the lift again I started to shiver again and my teeth chattering. I still managed to get off it and also to slide down the slope (really slow again - but I didn't want to crash like before), this time without falling. I have to say, I started enjoying the skiing a bit but it was physically very tough. I guess when you are properly dressed it's not so hard. I mean, your body has to put a lot of energy into keeping it running without collapsing I think. </p>

<p>Again I managed to get off the lift again without falling but the slide down wasn't that successful this time. I had tried to go a little faster but my muscles didn't respond properly anymore as I was all tense from the constant shivering (I don't even talk about goosebumps - I had them constantly since we left the restaurant). So at about halfway down the hill and fell badly again but this time on my bum. Snow and ice can feel like fire but this time I was panicking less than before and, yeah, I didn't lose my bikini this time. </p>

<p>When I finally came to a halt, my bum cheeks hurt like hell and I had really difficulties to get back on my feet. My shivering had become less intense, I believe because of exhaustion. Frank said to me: "I think we should call it a day, you did fantastic but it's getting dark anyway and we've still got some plans for today." I nodded and he helped me going down the last meters of the slope. </p>

<p>We made a quick stop at the restaurant where I had another hot chocolate. That was good! This time we didn't stay too long and took the lift back to the valley. This time I had no problems getting off but whilst we were going down the sun got behind the mountains and suddenly it felt much, much colder when we were in the shadow. </p>

<p>Not only my whole body felt somewhat numb at this point but my mind too worked a lot slower than usual. That's why my memory is a little bit blurred about what happened next. I know we left the skiing stuff at the administration centre, that I was happy to get off the heavy boots and back into my sandals. </p>

<p>I completely lost my sense of time during the ride back in the car. I don't know if it took long or not. I remember sitting in my seat, freezing, my teeth chattering but I can't really say how I felt, whether we talked or if we listened to music. I was so happy I didn't have to drive. I would surely had an accident.</p>

<p>Frank helped me out of the car when we arrived at the chalet. He had to guide me into the house, undressed me and took me into the shower where he turned on the warm water. At first I screamed, as it felt like thousands of needles, as the warm water touched my ice cold skin - actually, as I said before, the water wasn't that warm, but in this moment it felt like if it were boiling. </p>

<p>After a while I began to enjoy it and the the normal feeling returned to my body and I regained control over my muscles. </p>

<p>I don't know how long I stayed in the shower but when I did it was almost completely dark outside. I felt much better but I felt all my muscles aching and my skin was covered all over with scratches and bruises, but nothing that wouldn't go away. I dried myself and put on lotions, perfume and make up and went naked to the living room where Frank expected me with a glass of schnapps.</p>

<p>I sat beside him on the sofa and sipped on the glass. He put his hand on my naked thigh and asked: "Ready for dinner?" I nodded and asked what I should put on. He answered "nothing, my dear. We're gonna have a picnic. No need to get dressed at all." </p>

<p>Curious about the picnic and how it went on? Today is such a beautiful day, so I'm going to spend it at the lake. I'll try to continue tomorrow. As always feedback and critique is very much appreciated!</p>

<p>I like your way of writing, how you describe your feelings and thoughts. I laughed when I read that you were squeezing your $%!@ to to give yourself a push before continuing. The picture in my mind was great.</p>

<p>I wish I had been one of the Italian guys (or even better - Frank!)</p>

<p>@bassdrummer:</p>

<p>Here's the thing: Whenever I find an interesting video or image somewhere I download it (hence I have a huge and badly sorted collection). "Freezing" is neither my only nor my primary fetish but I love to see naked or barely dressed good looking women in adverse weather. I really admire them for their endurance and their willingness to suffer for being sexy.</p>

<p>I searched a couple of times for "girl", "woman", "snow", "naked", "ice", "bare legs" and other related terms in different combinations. When I get to something interesting, I always look through the uploader's other videos, their subscriptions and favourites and so on, this usually leads to other interesting stuff, but not necessarily on the same topic.</p>

<p>So, in order to comply with your request (which I really want to do at some point, especially as others might also be interested) I can't just go and copy and paste my "freezing bookmarks" (I don't have anything like that - yet). No, I have to look through my subscriptions and find and copy the links. As many videos might have been deleted over the years I would also have to scan through my archive and upload the interesting stuff to some platform myself. </p>

<p>Besides that, I work about 10 hours per day, I have a wife and a daughter, friends and hobbies, I have to help in the household, do my tax return, repair our bikes etc. and we're looking for a house to buy. Looking through videos - either on disk or on the internet - is (for me) a rather private activity and you can possibly imagine how much time I have for myself, and then ask yourself how far up in my priority list this is, when I might also be reading a book, the news, watch a film on TV, take a bath or whatever else.</p>

<p>Yes, I'd love to post some links, but it might still take some time.</p>

<p>@shiverfan, @gfx, @laloli and all others: Your stories have been great and if you post more, you'll surely get great feedback from me and others!</p>

<p>your details are astonishing. How long would you say you would chatter your teeth before they would finally stop? It sounds like you were constantly chattering and shivering. And did you have constant goosebumps? Those scenarios sound incredible!!! I'm curious though would you say you have a lot of hair on your arms or no, because generally from what I've seen the more hair, the more intense the goosebumps? </p>

<p>@laloli: What a wonderful description of a fantastic experience. I really feel as if I am there when I read your entries. I thought Frank was being a little bit harsh on you during the skiing but what a wonderful experience he gave you. And may I say - Congratulations!! I am really happy for you. But please don't stop writing, will you?</p>

<p>Before I discovered this forum I just thought I was weird. I never met anyone else who enjoyed being cold, which I have done since being a small child.</p>

<p>@gfx: One of my fantasies is someone who clears out their wardrobe of all the "boring" clothes. Wow, now you have no choice but to shiver in the winter! And to do it in a place that gets so cold too - you are amazing! It's prompted me to do the same, but what do I do with the jacket my partner bought me last autumn "because you only have that really thin one you wear"? I only wore that to stop the comments...</p>

<p>First of all: thanks to all for your lovely responses! They make it worth the time to continue writing. I'm not the fastest in typing and English is not my first language, that makes the whole thing quite an effort.</p>

<p>@daewongkim1994: OK, I now learned that teeth "chatter" not "shatter" - thanks for helping me improving my English. </p>

<p>I don't take many photos myself, sometimes I take a snapshot or a short video with my mobile, but it never really occurred to me to film myself in such a situation. Considering the large number of requests I'm getting, I think I should have done it - could have been fun and a small but considerable extra income. </p>

<p>Many clients have been taking photos or videos during some assignments, also on very cold days, but I don't have them. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do work wise in the future but I actually think I would like to do some erotic modeling. Shivering or freezing videos could be something I could specialize in. I don't mind very much feeling cold, there's surely a demand and apparently there are not too many girls doing it. I's not a decision I'm likely to take in the next weeks or so but I'll keep you posted.</p>

<p>As for your other questions: </p>

<p><i>How long would you say you would chatter your teeth before they would finally stop?</i></p>

<p>There's no general answer to that. As long as I'm really, really cold but still have force it can go on for a very long time. After half an hour or so my jaws begin to hurt. So it's often an on/off thing.</p>

<p>I wasn't constantly chattering and shivering. In times of great physical activity I wasn't. Goosebumps I had practically all the time, except when inside, shivering a lot - I'd say more than half of the time, teeth chattering after a lot of shivering until getting completely exhausted.</p>

<p><i>I'm curious though would you say you have a lot of hair on your arms or no</i></p>

<p>I have visible hair on my arms, but not a lot - otherwise I'd shave it like on my legs and on my $%!@.</p>

<p><i>Wow, what a person you are to go through all of this!!</i></p>

<p>Well, I thought the same about <u>shiverfan's</u> girlfriend. Maybe my assignments were physically more demanding but I'd definitely say that if I was in the fridge, she was deep frozen! I mean, she took hours and hours without physical activity, spent a lot of time in icy water and was constantly rubbed down with snow. </p>

<p>@shiverfan and @gfx: please post more stories too!</p>

<p>Sunday's adventures will follow soon!</p>

<p>Sorry guys - no update today, the day is just too beautiful to spend it in front of the PC. Many thanks for the wonderful feedback and the congratulations - I will continue posting.</p>

<p>@shiverfan - your girlfriend still amazes me with her level of endurance - what you were applying to her sounds almost like torture rather than an erotic game. No wonder you had to tie her up. She must be very, very proud of what she's able to take!</p>

<p>@shiverfan: I didn't say nor did I think it was torture - I was just amazed how much she could endure! And perhaps it's a girly thing but I was missing a little bit of environment. In your other story you just told more about the whole setup, her reactions, the feelings. Your last story was more like a list of facts than a story (but still interesting).</p>

<p>@all others: I'll try to finish the next chapter today when I find the time.</p>

<p>@laloli: And what Frank did to you wasn't torture I suppose...? :-) With the ice and hot wax. Looking forward to the next instalment.</p>

<p>@shiverfan: I enjoyed your story. What I liked the most was that after all the freezing with the ice she still sat naked in the cold wind from the fans for two hours watching the film, like that was perfectly normal. Maybe the cold air felt warm to her ice-cold skin? Or she just enjoys being cold...</p>

<p>One winter evening last year, me and my bf decided to go see a movie at this special theater. It was about 2 miles away. All I had on was a sleeveless pink dress and a 4-inch long white miniskirt that was so short that it was completely covered by the dress. I dress like this all the time but this time was definitely one of the coldest. Before we left our place, we heard on the radio that it was 35F outside extremely windy and with a high chance of rain but me and my bf decided against bringing an umbrella (my bf had a big coat on anyways). We decided to walk to the theater even though it was very far and I had to walk through a crowded part of NYC wearing next to nothing. By the time we got there, I was shivering with huge goosebumps and chattering teeth and my legs were bright red from the cold. During the walk, the wind blew the thin fabric of my dress and skirt up several times and the wind made my nipples poke out of my dress which feels really sexy. We watched the movie together with me still shivering from the cold the whole time. </p>

<p>After the movie, we walked out of the theater and saw everyone with umbrellas because there was extremely heavy rain. My bf suggested that we take the bus but I told him I didn't want to wait and would rather run home instead. We started to run but after a block, I couldn't run because my legs were starting to go numb from the cold and I had high heels on. The cold water dripped all over my ice cold body making me shake and shiver uncontrollably. My clothes and hair was completely wet so I basically felt ice cold everywhere. My bf asked if I wanted to go sit at this Korean restaurant that his friend works at and eat for a while but I told him I was on a diet. My bf tried to persuade me, telling me that I am skinny enough already at 5'10 and 110 lbs. But I told my bf I still had a bit of fat on my legs that I still want to get rid of so I can be even skinnier and after a while my bf complied. We walked through the heavy rain with me shaking every step from the cold. I got a lot of sexy stares from bypassers and one guy even offered me his umbrella but I declined it and told him I liked the feeling of cold rain on my skin lol </p>

<p>After a long walk, we finally got home. My bf said he loves me for being so tough and braving the cold for so long. I used up so much energy from shivering and chattering teeth that I just lied on my bed and fell asleep.</p>

<p>btw, guys I made a poll a while ago when I joined, would be nice if you check it out:

<p>@gfx: Nice story - thank you. In your other poll you say you don't like freezing yet here you say more than once that you do like the feeling of being cold or of cold rain on your skin. Do you like being cold or do you just do it for your boyfriend?</p>

<p>It's hard to remember what feeling cold is like with such warm weather at the moment...</p>

<p>@shiverfan: thanks
@wildswimmer: I like feeling cold because it makes me feel sexy, not because I want to be cold although being cold is so much better than being warm :) And I actually don't specifically do it for my bf, I think he would like me no matter how I dress although he does love the way I dress now over anything else :)</p>

<p>And yea, I can't wait for winter, I'm planning to teach my younger sister to wear minimal clothes this winter. That's why I made the poll because she thinks no one else wears minimal clothes besides me. I think I have proved her wrong lol</p>

<p>Having just read all 46 pages of posts, I suddenly feel rather disappointed in myself.  I don't have any stories to share!  My favorite was shiverfan's story concerning Elizabeth.  I loved it when she fell through the ice and would love to see more stuff like that!  Although I loved every story here, Elizabeth falling through the thin ice was, without a shadow of a doubt, my absolute favorite.  Personally, although I love it when the girl takes on the coldest of colds, I prefer it when she does rub her arms and futilely try to warm up, unlike the rest of you.</p>

<p>Hi Shiverfan, hi Wolfsbane,</p>

<p>do you prefer to see girls who obviously show that they are cold like crossing arms in front of their chest, rubbing arms, changing from one foot to the other, running for the next warm place etc. or do you prefer to watch girls who try to make people believe they are not cold as old like having their arms on their sides, walking slowly, having a chat etc. </p>

<p>For your girls: How do you behave? What prefers your husband / friend?
Do you always manage to pretend you are completely fine?</p>

<p>Allo Fred!</p>

<p>I prefer the ones who make it obvious by hugging themselves, rubbing their arms, and letting themselves stutter (my two favorite parts of shivering), but I don't mind it if a girl tries to act tough (though I will be disappointed).</p>

<p>Andrew</p>

<p>EDIT: Nice pics, lots of bravery, but very little shivering (that I could spot).</p>

I don't know something about when a girl even while inside if it's just air-conditioned or something, will rub their arms hard, really emphasize their chattering teeth, shiver really loudly then say something like "I'm f-f-freezing I have goosebumps" while rubbing their arms that is really sexy!</p>

<p>@wildswimmer: I agree with you, I prefer people who pretend they are fine even when they're freezing. If you are wearing a mini skirt on snowy days, everyone knows you are cold so I don't see a point in showing it. You look sexy and you're freezing either way, why do the extra work?
And I agree, the more you experience the cold, the more you get used to it. Before I started dressing minimally, I usually felt the cold with bare arms bare legs when it was like 70 degrees, now I only start feeling the cold when it is around 40-50 degrees. </p>

<p>One request, can u take pictures of when u are outdoor for us? Or at least share your freezing daily while Mid November begins? We are lack of good story after Lissy and Shiverfan disappear and me is more an observer then a cold endorser. Plus HK would never get as cold as your place is too. And am living with my family, so it is hard to dress minimal with them with me all the time.   </p>

<p>@Ferfred: Not really, I am naturally thin due to genes but I am also a vegetarian which also makes me thin. My height is 5'10, my waist is 23 in, my thigh is 18 in and I weight about 110 lbs :) I live in an apartment where the heat is controlled so I don't get to feel the cold at home. And yes, I only use cold water and often take cold baths during the summer to maintain my ability to brave the cold. </p>

<p>As for my sister, she is living with me for now. She still thinks I'm a bit crazy (although she is also a bit jealous cuz I look sexier lol) to wear miniskirts in the snow but I'm slowly changing out her wardrobe so she'll be in for a surprise once winter comes around :) </p>

<p>@ Wolfs: it actually snowed for the first time this year where I lived today. Seems like winter is coming early :) I wore a tank top and a miniskirt today and had a nice walk with my bf after work to get some good old snow covering my thin arms and legs. </p>

<p>@ joyce: I don't have any good cameras (just use phone camera) so the quality will probably turn out pretty bad especially in bad weather. Why did everyone leave? And yes, HK is a much warmer place, I've visited before, its also very crowded even compared to NYC. Are you a student? I remember back in the day when I wore warm clothes, I regret it. Gotta thank my bf for changing that :)</p>

<p>hey Chilly, I'm glad you like my stories :)</p>

<p>I travel to work by bus and subway so I have to put up with the cold in winter. Sometimes, the buses are unpredictable so there are days when I have to wait half an hour for a bus to and from work in the cold. I go to work with a college friend who lives in the same apartment building as me and during the middle of winter, she would be wearing like a long wool coat with hat, scarf, gloves, thick pants and wool boots while I stand next to her wearing only a 8 inch miniskirt and a sleeveless denim shirt. You would be surprised at all the shocking faces and starring I get when I enter the bus :) I work for a Korean company and my boss is totally okay with me wearing miniskirt as long as it doesn't show my butt, in fact, he actually likes it and comments on my dressing style from time to time.</p>

<p>Hi gfx, for sure you have a good and thin figure ;-)
Are you never tempted to have a hot shower / bath when you come home ice cold and freezing for a longer period? Do you sleep with a cover when you are alone or with your boyfriend or other friends?
When you are waiting at the bus stop for example, do you try to behave as normal as possible like having the arms on your sides, your legs in a confortable position, chatting etc. or do you cross your arms etc.? Can you avoid that your body starts shaking hard due to the cold?
Any interesting stories already this upcoming winter season?

<p>Thanks Ferfred :)</p>

<p>Yes, I am tempted to have a hot shower and I do occasionally. The thing is that I need to have cold showers to boost my ability to brave the cold. When I go to sleep with my bf, I always sleep without a cover in minimal clothing because my bf loves to touch my ice cold skin. I usually wake up shivering and my bf warms me up a bit b4 I get ready for work. 
When I am standing outside, I try to behave normally although you can clearly see that I am shivering with bluish skin. It is hard to avoid shivering so I usually just let my body do its job. Most ppl like my shivering and find it very attractive :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am still there! I have been very busy, though, and I hardly find time to write.</p>

<p>@gfx: You must look very sexy with your cold, er, hot thin body dressed in next to nothing despite freezing weather! I think you look much better in skimpy clothes if you have a really slim figure. I am about as tall as you and also quite thin. My bf likes me to be very thin, and I have been feeling the cold much more intensive the thinner I have got, which I enjoy very much ;-). So I still want to be thinner :-) Do you try to lose some more weight as well?
It is amazing that a cold cannot stop you from wearing short clothes, there are not many girls who are that consequent about their style. But that goes without saying if you want to look sexy! I have been sick with a cold since Saturday, but like you I do not cover up the slightest bit ;-).</p>

<p>Ciao,
Lissy</p>

<p>Hi Lissy, nice to see you around. I read some of the earlier posts on this thread, your stories are amazing!
I agree, the thinner you are, the better you look with minimal clothes on. My bf also wants me to be very thin so I look even sexier and my skin gets even colder. And yea, the thinner you are, the colder you feel, especially when you are wearing a tank top and miniskirt outside in the  winter! 
tbh, I don't try very hard in losing weight, I am naturally thin and have been very thin my whole life and the same goes for my brother and sister :) lol ppl tell me its Asian genes. I haven't gotten sick yet so far although I have been freezing outside everyday, I guess it gets easier year by year lol Thanks for the compliments, I look forward to hearing some of your stories soon!</p>

<p>@wolfs: yes I tried ice skating once with my bf and we both failed at it haha</p>

<p>these photos are from the chillygirls website. this used to be one good site to get shivering videos, but unfortunately they have stopped doing updates. but the old vids are still there for downloading, I think. just sing up and get them, if you haven't already, then quit again. videos are so much better than photos, cause you can see the shivering. </p>

<p>there is another page, outdoorbdsm, there are some good shivering videos too. they also have stopped updating though. </p>

<p>@Callen: I personally wouldn't recommend that site in fact me and my bf watched a vid last night and both of us hated it. The point of freezing in the winter is to look pretty and feminine, not to go nude and do tricks for horny men like dogs. I think wearing minimal clothes looks good but not naked. Like for me, I usually wear a soft cute miniskirt that feels good for my butt but also allows me to show off my super thin thighs and long legs. I also like to wear sleeveless tops that allows me to show my collar bones, my thin shoulders, and my long thin arms. But I would never let anyone see my private parts (besides bf) or do tricks for anyone, that's just not right :(</p>

<p>I'm interested in the idea of using cold showers to toughen up for wearing skimpy outfits but I also think they can be incredibly invigorating and a really intense sensual experience in their own right! They can help boost immunity, tone skin and make hair shiny as well as help with weight loss by boosting the metabolism. I was wondering how many people here take cold showers regularly? Inside or outside? I'm presuming always with absolutely no clothes for the most effective and intense reaction! A thorough scrub all over with a nice firm body brush can make the treatment even more effective. As well for cold endurance the sudden contrast from hot to cold can be a real rush and intensely sensual: taking a hot bath then an ice cold shower, or a contrast shower, or maybe leaping into an ice cold shower immediately after waking up to really get your body going! I can also appreciate how refreshing it must be to, say, go for a run in really minimal clothes on a cold day, and jump into a cold shower afterwards. European spas offer a beauty treatment where you stand at the end of a short tunnel and get thoroughly hosed down (front and back) with a powerful high pressure cold water jet. I would like to hear from anyone who has experienced any of these things!</p>

<p>Two or three mornings a week I go for a run before breakfast. I wear a thin short running vest and running shorts. When I leave the house I wear flip-flops because the lane down to the fields from the end of our street is rather stony. Once I get to the fields though I hide the flip-flops in the long grass and continue barefoot. After ten minutes I'm by the river. I take off my vest, and slip into the water. In the summer it's lovely and cool – in the winter it is frigid. But each day throughout the autumn it's only a little colder each time than the last time, and last time it was OK so this time it's not so bad. I swim for up to ten minutes, often deciding to get out, then as I approach the bank turning round and swimming again, sometimes pulling my vest off the bank into the water with me. I climb out, put on my vest and run back across the fields. I never take a towel. In winter the grass is covered in frost, and the sun is just rising, often with a low red horizon and a deep blue sky. I can no longer feel my bare feet slapping the icy grass. Back at the path I put on my flip-flops for the run down the lane back to our street and home. Often I see no one at all during my run, sometimes just the odd dog-walker. Some of them look at me strangely, others, who have seen me before say a cheery hello.</p>

<p>Once home I have a shower. If I haven't run, this is also how I begin my day.</p>

<p>I always have a cold shower, the water turned right down – there is no hot water, just as it comes out of the cold tap. The pressure is high and the cold water pummels my skin. After the river in winter though, it feels slightly warmer. I start by spraying my legs, then my arms, once quickly round my waist and up my back. Then it's up the front, back on the hook and I'm standing right under it, the cold water running through my hair and all down my freezing body. I'm in there for maybe ten minutes, by which time I'm shaking and covered in goose bumps, even in the summer.</p>

<p>I only quickly get dry, with a quick wipe of the towel. I never dry my arms, instead putting on my short-sleeved top over my wet arms.</p>

<p>The cool kitchen actually feels fairly warm after the cold shower. I often go outside to eat my cereal in the garden barefoot, even in the frost. If I'm on a diet though the cereal goes and it's just a glass of fruit juice.</p>

<p>I drive to work – it takes nearly an hour each way. I never put the heater on, whatever the temperature, and often have the windows open. I used to have a soft top convertible and would put the top down unless it was raining, whatever the temperature. Of course I am only wearing my short-sleeved or sleeveless top, and there's no coat in the car at all.</p>

<p>I arrive at the office absolutely frozen. The stair handrail feels so warm even though it's probably only 18C. My desk is right opposite the air-conditioner outlet which blows cold air at me all day long.</p>

<p>The drive home is just as cold as the drive in and in winter in the dark I have the windows open the whole time. Once on a particularly snowy night I broke down and I had to wait an hour and a half in the cold and dark. The engine wouldn't start and pretty soon the car was icing up before I was rescued. Finally I reach my rather cool house for the evening.</p>

<p>If I go into town in the evening I never wear long sleeves. I always cycle in and home again. People sometimes stare, but I'm soon past and disappear into the dark.</p>

<p>I always sleep naked with no bed clothes and the window open, the cold night air flooding in like a waterfall over the bed. I can't sleep if I'm warm. Sometimes I wake up cold in the middle of the night but I soon drift off again. After a cold night's sleep I'm up again for my cold run and swim or my cold shower.</p>

<p>At the weekends I may go for a longer cycle ride into the countryside, always in shorts and short-sleeved or sleeveless top. I may stop off at a lake to go for a longer swim in the cool or cold water, then cycle home all wet. Once home I'll have a cold shower and some alcohol to warm me up.</p>

<p>Yeah, I run barefoot down to about -5 Celsius, sometimes colder, but it depends how I feel at the moment. This morning we had almost -20 so I had to wear clogs when I went into town. Not really bikini-weather! I wore a knee-length dress and a warm vest.</p>

<p>Hi Lena (I take it the "bf" is for "barefoot"?) Don't worry what people around you think you should be wearing, or people here think you shouldn't be wearing. Wear what you like! -5C - wow! I can't wait for some snow to try that here. In deep snow way below zero I prefer little ankle boots (pixie boots), without socks of course.</p>

<p>Well, at those temperatures you have to protect yourself a bit.
The snow really burns under your feet and severe damage can occur.

als der tag soweit war, war es furchtbar kalt und ein eisiger wind wehte, ich hatte eine dicke jacke an und mir war bitterlich kalt. 
Sie selber fror auch, wollte es aber zuerst nicht zugeben schon im auto unter ihrer jacke war ihr kalt und sie hatte gänsehaut.
Als wir ausstiegen und sie ihre jacke und hose auszog war ihr kompletter körper sofort in Gänsehaut gehüllt und sie fing sofort an zu zittern.
Sie hatte einen gelben knappen bikini und schöne higheels an....
Wir gingen um einen See der weg war ungefähr 5km lang nach der hälfte des Weges konnte sie kaum mehr laufen so am zittern war sie, als ich sie fragte ob ich das auto holen sollte sagte sie nur nein, ich schaffe das schon.....ihre gänsehaut war wunderschön anzusehen.....als wir wieder am auto waren und später zuhause brauchte sich fast 1,5h bis sie nicht mehr am zittern war und ihr langsam wärmer wurde. 
 Es war ein unvergesslicher Abend....</p>

<p>ok ... here goes ... i remember a day in winter when my girl friend asked me ... shall we do something crazy? i asked ... what do you have in mind? she replied ... what about we go for a walk in the snow, and i will only wear my bikini? i was stunned and excited at the same time. when our adventure started, it was a terribly cold day with an icy wind blowing. i wore a thick jacket and was still freezing. my girl was cold herself, but did not want to admit it at first. in the car, when she still wore a jacket on top, she was very cold already and had goose bumps all over. when we left the car and she dropped her jacket and pants, she was covered in goose bumps all over in a matter of seconds. plus she started shivering right away. she wore a yellow bikini and sexy high heels. we walked around a lake, about 5 kilometers. about half way into our walk, she could barely continue because her shivering got so frantic. i asked her if i should run to get the car but she declined and said she could handle the cold. her goose bumps were a gorgeous sight to behold. back to the car and on the way home, she needed about an hour and a half to stop shaking and started to get warm again slowly. it was an evening to always remember ...</p>

<p>hi Ferfred, I'm doing fine :)
I haven't been on here for a while because I was on a trip to South Korea with my bf and some other friends. It has been pretty cold there (10-20F). The only clothes I brought with me were miniskirts all shorter than 10 inches and paper thin see-through tank tops. Of course, my friend and cousins and sister had warmer clothes and all the guys had huge jackets.  The moment I walked out of the airport, my whole body started shivering uncontrollably and my nipples were piercing through the thin fabric of my tank top. Midnight is pretty cold in South Korea. Now here comes the fun part. All of us got into the taxi and the driver kept trying to get a look at me through the car's mirror. Then, he asks me "Do you have pants on?" It was actually a pretty good question because my tank top entirely covered my micro mini skirt and you really couldn't tell. Over here, lot of girls wear mini skirts in the winter so I had to wear shorter ones to stand out :) Anyways, I told him I did and then he asked if I was some pop star he didn't know about lol He also complemented me on my long, thin legs and he was very interested at how I started dressing like this so I told him the whole story. And then he was like "I'm gonna make you freezing cold!" and he opened all the windows in the middle of the highway to make me shiver but he closed in after like 10 minutes because he said he was too cold himself and was like "damn, you girls are too good." Really cool taxi driver, hopefully I get a ride from him when I go to Korea again one day :)</p>

Not exactly ;-) I am currently living with a hot young girl :-o  In fact, she is a female apprentice who is still looking for an affordable accommodation in town.
I dress very much as in summer - short skirts and sleeveless blouses for work, hot pants and small tops otherwise ;-). No surprise, since you are not likely to find any items in my wardrobe that you could call winter clothes <em>g</em>.</p>

<p>@winter89:
I can't really remember, there were so many ;-) Maybe the coldest part is when I have to walk home for about half an hour after clubbing, in wind, rain or hail and snow. If my  night out has unexpectedly <em>g</em> turned into an all-nighter again, I have to catch the bus home, change, and then get on the bus once more to arrive at work in time, or even take the bus from town directly to work. In every case, I have to wait at the unsheltered bus stop, sometimes for more than 20 minutes, which is not exactly warm either ;-) Ich spreche uebrigens auch deutsch - magst mir mal scheiben?</p>

<p>@gfx:
Wow, seems you had a nice trip there ;-) Did you take the opportunity on another occasion, as suggested by the taxi driver to go out without pants and let the cold air tingle you up there between your legs? :-) I enjoy the cold breeze up there, the tingling and buzzing kind of turns me on <em>g</em>. I guess it is not a big surprise that I do not wear any pants at all if I can get away without ;-) You seem to be wearing even less now that the weather turned really cold and nasty - have you already caught some cold or other in this season, and do you still dress even more lightly then? I enjoy feeling the cold more intensely and shivering more violently when I am sick ;-)</p>

<p>hi lissy, I would like to try going without pants but that is illegal in both US and Korea. And yes, I have been wearing even less and therefore, shivering even more! And in fact, I got sick right after the trip and still a bit sick right now, I still dress the same in tank tops and mini skirts. My body gets sooo cold when I am sick but I just take medicine and continue to freeze. In fact, three days ago, at the height of my sickness, my bf had to hold on to me so I don't fall from the intense shivering. My entire body was filled with huge goosebumps and my arms and legs turned bright red because I was sick and all I had on was a paper thin tank top and an 8-inch mini skirt. I enjoyed it though</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,
if you are still below 90 lbs there is not much weight to loose. How can you reduce your "diet" even more? Is your boyfriend encouraging you to get even thinner?</p>

<p>Is "your" girl as well involved in your dressing style? Is she encouraging you or does she try to keep up with you?</p>

<p>Do you go to work in your party outfit if you stayed out whole night? How does your boss and colleagues react when you get to work scantily clad and shivering?</p>

<p>Hi gfx,
you said "Of course, my friend and cousins and sister had warmer clothes and all the guys had huge jackets." Does this mean that at least some of the other girls were also dressed not appropriate for the time of the year but had still more than you?</p>

<p>Was it your idea to bring only so little clothing or was it a challenge of your boyfriend?</p>

<p>When you where see trough tops is it just to show you donÂ´t anything else although you are freezing or does it give you an extra thrill itself?</p>

<p>For sure you had more interesting situations during your trip. </p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>-> I would like to try going without pants but that is illegal in both US and Korea. </p>

<p>Too bad! However, I do not quite understand why you cannot  try it with a miniskirt. No one can tell whether you wear anything underneath - at least officially ;-). Being a gorgeous sexy girl, you are very likely to get away with it anyway.
I think it is very adorable how you keep up your sexy style even under "adverse" circumstances <em>g</em>. Your bf is a very happy man, I guess. We had 20F weather last night, with driving sleet. The girl who stays with me and I were looking forward to having some fun in the city with just two working days left before holiday. She dressed up rather warmly in a pink longsleeve paired with jeans and sneakers. I went out in a thin white halter-neck cropped top and ultra-low-rise denim hot pants from which I had cut off the waistband and pant legs such that my hip bones and lower buttocks showed. I wore nothing else despite still being sick with a cough, and I was super cold and shivering intensely (probably I had a temperature) with huge goosebumps all over my barely clad body, and I enjoyed it very much. We must be some kind of souls sisters ;-). Would you like to email me?</p>

<p>Love,
Lissy</p>

<p>Hi lissy,</p>

<p>Yea, miniskirts are basically no pants to me since they are so short my shirt covers most of it anyways. And thank you :) I really like your story, you really enjoy showing off your body just like me! I like dressing minimally when I'm sick, it kind of makes me forget that I am sick actually. And btw, you are only 90 lbs? How tall are you?</p>

<p>Hi ferfred, </p>

<p>Yes, I meant most of the other girls were also wearing very little. Basically, we were all wearing mini skirts because it is fashionable there (except I think one of my friend had pantyhose and another had leggings). But yea, some of us were bare legs, I was the only one who didn't have my arms covered up though. I wear see through tops to show that's all I'm wearing lol and of course it feels a lot colder if the material is very thin.</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>->Yea, miniskirts are basically no pants to me since they are so short my shirt covers most of it anyways.</p>

<p>I do not wear anything under my miniskirts as well, it is a very cool feeling when I sit down with my bare buttocks on a bench or the cold stones of some stairs outside - especially if there is snow on the ground ;-) I love it! </p>

<p>->I really like your story, you really enjoy showing off your body just like me!</p>

<p>Thank you! We have really something in common there ;-)</p>

<p>->I like dressing minimally when I'm sick, it kind of makes me forget that I am sick actually.</p>

<p>So do I. I suppose that is why I wear even less then, it makes me forget and surprisingly I really feel fine and sexy despite being sick if I can look good and show off even more of my thin body. The intensified sensation of cold, extra huge goosebumps on my bluish skin, and uncontrollable shivering is another story and turns me really on at times <em>g</em>.</p>

<p>->And btw, you are only 90 lbs? How tall are you?</p>

<p>I am about as tall as you at 5'10'' (1,79 m). My weight presently hovers just below 100 lbs - thank the christmas meals :-( - but I am trying to get rid of the additional pounds again. </p>

<p>Hi ferfred,</p>

<p>->Is your boyfriend encouraging you to get even thinner?</p>

<p>Since I am living with a girl, she is my main support now ;-) However, I have the impression that boys generally are more interested in skinny girls, so that is some kind of encouragement for me as well <em>g</em>.</p>

<p>->Is "your" girl as well involved in your dressing style? Is she encouraging you or does she try to keep up with you?</p>

<p>Not at first, but during fall she started asking questions about my still-summery style. Well I said that I enjoyed the looks I got and certainly she noticed how the guys reacted. She also appreciates that you should have a slim figure if you want to wear figure-hugging clothes, so we both started on a diet after christmas. I guess it will not be long until she wants to find out herself ;-)</p>

<p>->Do you go to work in your party outfit if you stayed out whole night?</p>

<p>No, I change at my office, I always keep an emergency set of business attire there <em>g</em>.</p>

<p>->How does your boss and colleagues react when you get to work scantily clad and shivering?</p>

<p>Since my business clothes are not exactly warm either (sleeveless blouse, short skirt; I only add a blazer for meetings with executive staff), my colleagues got used to my clothing style, my boss does not seem to bother, at least he tolerates it as long as I get my work done right. Most of the time I am out of office anyway, working as a field representative.</p>

<p>Hey Lizzy,</p>

<p>I really enjoy reading your posts, I have a few questions for you:</p>

<p>Why do you enjoy being cold? What about it exactly turns you on? I mean, do you enjoy rubbing your arms and feeling goosebumps? Or hearing your teeth chatter?</p>

<p>I noticed when you said you have "extra huge goosebumps" do you have a lot of arm hair? I know that generally the more hair a girl has on her arms, the bigger the goosebumps. Some girls I know have almost no hair and when they get cold just have small bumps all over, but other girls who have so much hair especially on their forearms, you can see the goosebumps a mile away. </p>

<p>Do you ever take pictures or videos when you are cold? </p>

<p>and finally</p>

<p>Do you get goosebumps easily? Because I know people who could be shivering and chattering teeth but still have none, and others who at the slightest chill have their arms, back, legs, and chest covered in goosebumps, which is most of the time.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>->Why do you enjoy being cold? What about it exactly turns you on? I mean, do you enjoy rubbing your arms and feeling goosebumps? Or hearing your teeth chatter?</p>

<p>I do not rub my arms, at least I try to suppress the urge as long as I can ;-). Same for chattering teeth. Maybe I enjoy just that, pretending everything is normal, and the bewildered reactions of people who cannot understand how I can be warm enough when at the same time my body shows obvious signs of freezing <em>g</em>. It is that contrast that makes things interesting. On the other hand, when I start to really freeze after some time outside and my shivering finally becomes uncontrollable, with chattering teeth, and chills running down my goosebumps, this adds another shot of adrenaline to my already considerable arousal from all the looks and comments ;-). At this point, when I can look sexy in skimpy clothes, I would never admit that my body is probably near or beyond its cold tolerance <em>g</em>, so it is also a kind of challenge for me to show my cold resistance by wearing next to nothing and showing as much as possible of my unprotected thin body ;-). Sounds weird, but it is fun!</p>

<p>->I noticed when you said you have "extra huge goosebumps" do you have a lot of arm hair? I know that generally the more hair a girl has on her arms, the bigger the goosebumps. Some girls I know have almost no hair and when they get cold just have small bumps all over, but other girls who have so much hair especially on their forearms, you can see the goosebumps a mile away</p>

<p>No, I do not have much hair on my arms to begin with, and I shave off the rest when I do my legs. However, my goosebumps are pretty big anyway. I think it depends on which skin type you are. Mine is the southernly naturally tanned type, rather smooth when I am warm, but when I get cold I get goosebumps easily, first soft and later huge, I am not sure whether you can see them from a mile away though, hehe.</p>

<p>->Do you ever take pictures or videos when you are cold?</p>

<p>Not on a regular basis, but my friends may have taken some private shots.</p>

<p>->Do you get goosebumps easily? Because I know people who could be shivering and chattering teeth but still have none, and others who at the slightest chill have their arms, back, legs, and chest covered in goosebumps, which is most of the time.</p>

<p>Yes I do. In fact, I feel the cold quite easily due to my skinny figure, there is not that much (actually still too much :-() insulating fat ;-). The first reaction of my body to a cold breeze is goosebumps erupting all over my skin. Later, when shivering and teeth chattering set in, they get considerably bigger and a reddish, then a bluish hue.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Lissy!! This is really incredible! :) :)</p>

<p>Most people don't enjoy being cold enough for something like this. My sweet girlfriend knows about my fetish and she tries to accommodate but she can only go so far. She knows I love feeling her goosebumps and hear her chattering teeth. She gets really really cold really easily and gets goosebumps a lot. She's the type to be cold in a long-sleeved shirt if it's 65 or 70 degrees F outside. However she's been trying lately. Here it's been about 20 degrees outside and lots of snow. She still tries to wear short skirts and short sleeved shirts with lace. Whenever we go into her basement, she gets goosebumps right away and starts chattering her teeth. But she can only get so far before it becomes too much for her. It is really nice for a little while but she eventually gets too cold to continue and has to get a blanket or something. I love her so much but I do wish she had half the cold tolerance you do! ;) </p>

<p>If you don't mind me asking what country are you from?</p>

"Yeah, I run barefoot down to about -5 Celsius, sometimes colder, but it depends how I feel at the moment.</p>

<p>@Wildswimmer:
"When I leave the house I wear flip-flops because the lane down to the fields from the end of our street is rather stony. Once I get to the fields though I hide the flip-flops in the long grass and continue barefoot."</p>

<p>I run barefoot and bare-legged in winter as well (actually -10C is my limit to go barefoot). As you Wildswimmer do, I leave the house with shoes on then hide them when I reach the park: Canadian sidewalks are very corrosive in winter because all the chemical road salt they put on every part of concrete. At least parks are free of salt so I can run barefoot there.</p>

<p>@Wildswimmer:
"I swim for up to ten minutes, often deciding to get out, then as I approach the bank turning round and swimming again, sometimes pulling my vest off the bank into the water with me."</p>

<p>I don't have any lake to swim in near my place, but I like the idea.
Sometime in winter (around 0C) I plunge into a river with my clothes on, I love the feeling of wet clothes in winter that gives you much energy (furthermore, people who stare you because they see you wet in winter is funny ;)</p>

<p>@Bf-Lena:"This morning we had almost -20 so I had to wear clogs when I went into town. Not really bikini-weather! I wore a knee-length dress and a warm vest."
"Well, at those temperatures you have to protect yourself a bit. The snow really burns under your feet and severe damage can occur."</p>

<p>I agree with you, bare feet, hands or head in -20 or -25C are a very bad idea. 
However bare legs are not a problem at all in such temperatures. I always go bare legged even in -25C plus windchill and don't feel the cold, I assume my legs are used to it in the same way as my face is used to it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your nice compliments!
I am sure your girlfriend will get used to being cold over time - I needed some time to accommodate as well. Has she already tried wearing short skirts and her sleeveless shirts outside, or just in her basement? Does she wear anything underneath her skirt, shirt, or on her legs? May I ask her figure, what does she weigh and how tall is she?</p>

<p>->If you don't mind me asking what country are you from?</p>

<p>I am from Germany. We get cold winters here as well, but unfortunately there is a warm spell here currently.</p>

<p>@ferfred</p>

<p>->Hi Lissy, maybe you like to keep us updated how much your friend who stays with you is involved in your dressing styles and diet plans, either by encouraging you or following your style.</p>

<p>Last week she tried once to go out in a short skirt without a jacket, and she almost froze to death ;-). When she came home, I could here her teeth chattering for almost an hour before she finally fell asleep. She plans on celebrating New Year's Eve at a friend's house, and later all of them going to an open-air New Year's Eve party. Now she is unsure of what to wear, at the house it will be hot and toasty, but certainly not at the party ;-) To bring a coat is not an option for her, because she wants to look sexy at the open-air party as well, and one of the girls has already announced to wear a dress her boyfriend gave her for christmas. I suggested that she wear something more revealing to make the guys' jaws drop, but she is not sure if she can handle the cold. It is funny to watch her digging through her wardrobe, trying on some tank top or skirt, and pondering whether she will survive until midnight, outside in such little clothing :-))
I believe the odds are turning in favor of that tiny top and miniskirt over there... <em>g</em></p>

<p>->Does she know about this board? Maybe she likes to report about your adventures from her point of view here.</p>

<p>She occasionally peeks on me posting here <em>g</em>. She says she is not ready to write in public about her or my adventures though.</p>

<p>->What is more demanding for you, the wether like now, windy, rainy but not really cold for december, or if it is even colder with snow etc.?</p>

<p>I get colder more quickly when I am wet I guess, and the windchill adds considerably to the process, as well as certainly the temperature itself. And snow melting on your bare skin also makes you wet ;-)</p>

<p>->Do you have any special plans for the New Year's Eve?</p>

<p>I will also go to the outdoor party, but with my friends. What do you think I will wear? ;-) Hehe!</p>

<p>A Happy New Year to you all,
Lissy</p>

<p>Lissy,</p>

<p>So you're from Germany? I come from the Northern USA, so we get frigid winters here as well. </p>

<p>My girlfriend is about 5-9 so rather tall and weighs roughly 110 pounds. She's thin but she has something to her. She is very very concerned about modesty. She wears short skirts but always wears leggings or tights underneath for modesty. She has never gone outside with a sleeveless shirt just the basement and even that's enough for her. I will get to one story in a sec that is always big in my memory.</p>

<p>You seem like the perfect girlfriend for a guy with a cold fetish. I cannot believe how amazing it must be for your boyfriend. There are a few things that always no matter what make me as incredibly turned on as possible. Hearing the chattering of a girl's teeth and the stuttering of her speech as she tries to talk with chattering teeth, feeling the nipple poke of a girl's nipple when extremely cold, and mostly above anything else, feeling the rough, bumpy texture of arms coated with goosebumps, especially if they're intense and have lots of hair. You sound absolutely perfect! :) If you ever did take pictures or videos I would definitely love to see!!</p>

<p>Now for my story, this happened a while ago while in high school. We went to a dance in February sponsored by our high school. Februaries in Norther USA usually get down at night to 0F or even lower. This day it was 12F and we went out to dinner first. She was wearing a stunning bluish green dress, sleeveless and strapless, and went to about her knees, leaving the rest of her legs bare. We got to the restaurant in daylight and she seemed to be taking the cold rather well as we walked in, much better than I imagined. I escorted her in and we sat down at the table where our other friends were. She looked so beautiful and she smiled so much. We were together about 4 months at this point, so still relatively new. As we sat there she took my hand and tried to lean in close. I asked her if everything was ok and she said "the door keeps opening" and I saw she was in direct line of the door. She shivered and as she shivered her entire body erupted in goosebumps. I put my arm around her the whole time as long as i could and it kept getting worse. She kept shuddering and every time more and more goosebumps. This happened for most of dinner but she still enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Now I recall she wanted to keep her coat in my car so as we walked out after dinner it was dark, and much colder. As soon as we walked out she gasped and her bare arms and shoulders and back coated with goosebumps. This time her teeth were chattering so she couldn't speak, and we hurried to the car. We got in and she just held onto me and wouldn't let me stop hugging and rubbing her. I could see her nipples poking so hard through her dress. It was a 25 minute drive to the school where the dance was and her teeth were chattering still and her body still had goosebumps. </p>

<p>This is the one instance where she was bare even outside, it had not happened since, but how does this compare to your experiences?</p>

<p>Happy new year lissy! Thank you for your comments!</p>

<p>Hi lissy,</p>

<p>I also love the cold feeling of sitting down on a cold surface with just a miniskirt on, I like it when my thin legs shiver :) And nice, we're the same height! You're a bit thinner than me though I weigh about 105-110 lbs. 100 lbs is soooo skinny, I'm jealous! lol And good luck on getting your roommate to dress like you, I am trying to do the same with my sister whose actually doing fairly well, she's able to wear miniskirts in around 30F weather but she still hasn't tried wearing a tank top in the winter yet! And please keep us updated on your roommate's starting experiences of braving the cold, those are always interesting stories!</p>

<p>I have a few questions for you.
How big are your goosebumps? I get a lot of goosebumps but they don't get really huge even when I am freezing cold, I have very little arm or leg hair lol My skin just usually turn bluish and redish and my body shivers a lot.</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>I enjoyed the story about your gf :) Your gf has around the same height and weight as me. Is your gf also Korean? :)
And I live in Northern USA too :) I agree, it has been pretty cold around here which was pretty enjoyable for me.
You should try to encourage your gf to wear less outside, you can still be modest even with bare arms and legs, your clothes just have to look nice xD
You're actually pretty similar to my bf, he also has a huge cold fetish and loves touching my freezing cold body. He usually has a boner when he touches me too LOL so I have hard nipples from the cold while he has a hard <em><em></em></em> haha</p>

<p>And happy new years everyone!</p>

<p>Hi Gfx</p>

<p>Thank you! :) She actually is mostly caucasian with some middle eastern influences. Beautiful, luscious long hair, petite figure, a very long body. Long arms, long legs etc. and very thin. She has some hair on her forearms which make her goosebumps rather intense and very visible. When she gets really cold she'll chatter her teeth a lot and her entire body will coat in goosebumps. Her back is covered, to her chest area, her arms from her shoulders down to her wrists especially on her forearms and about halfway down her upper arms. It actually makes my fingers tingle after rubbing them for a while, that's how intense they are! Where exactly are you? I'm from the southern Wisconsin area. </p>

<p>So you are saying you get a lot of goosebumps they're just small? Do you happen to have an pictures or videos? I know being Korean most of us don't have much hair on our arms so that makes sense. But still I'm sure it's still VERY sexy when it happens! :) Do your teeth chatter a lot too?</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>Your gf must be pretty attractive :) I'm from NYC.
And yea, I am covered in tons of small goosebumps like all the time. And yea, its probably because I don't have much hair on my arms or legs like most Koreans. With a very thin body, not much hair, and clothes, you can imagine I get extremely cold during the winter :) And yes, I chatter my teeth a lot although I try to suppress it so I don't look as cold lol
Unfortunately, I don't really have any pics or vids, my bf might have a few pics on his phone here and there. </p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>->I also love the cold feeling of sitting down on a cold surface with just a miniskirt on, I like it when my thin legs shiver :)</p>

<p>Yes, that really keeps your buttocks, belly, and thighs shivering cold ;-) Did you ever get a chill on the bladder, and nevertheless sit on a cold surface with bare thighs and buttocks?</p>

<p>->And nice, we're the same height! You're a bit thinner than me though I weigh about 105-110 lbs. 100 lbs is soooo skinny, I'm jealous! lol</p>

<p>Thank you very much! I think the difference, if any, could only be noticed if we stood side by side ;-)  I am trying to slim back to my 90 lbs again, though :-) But you seem to have lost some lbs, too! That is great, carry on!</p>

<p>->How big are your goosebumps? I get a lot of goosebumps but they don't get really huge even when I am freezing cold, I have very little arm or leg hair lol My skin just usually turn bluish and redish and my body shivers a lot.</p>

<p>Same here, although I consider my goosebumps becoming relatively large, albeit only when I am really freezing. I think it depends on the skin type. I have very little arm and leg hair as well, and I shave it off, so you have a plain view of my goosebumps without fur ;-)</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>Your girlfriend seems to be very pretty! It is a pity that her modesty seems to keep her from wearing sexy clothing, at least so in public. I have to agree that you can still be modest with bare arms and legs (with some exceptions even bare shoulders) if the apparel looks nice and stylish. After all it is more important who wears the clothes and how they are worn, than the clothes themselves. You both seem to have shivering fun anyway ;-).</p>

<p>->You seem like the perfect girlfriend for a guy with a cold fetish. I cannot believe how amazing it must be for your boyfriend.</p>

<p>Thank you! My former boyfriend and I were very happy when he took me out, I would wear skimpy clothes all along no matter what the weather would be like, and finally we would end up making out in the weirdest places <em>g</em>, but we parted for some other reasons. Currently I enjoy my life as a single, but I certainly do not miss a worthwhile opportunity ;-)</p>

<p>Very nice adventure with your girlfriend, thank you for sharing!</p>

<p>->Now I recall she wanted to keep her coat in my car</p>

<p>Do you remember why she wanted to keep her coat in your car? Didn't she expect it to be even colder after dark, or did she think she could manage?</p>

<p>->It was a 25 minute drive to the school where the dance was and her teeth were chattering still and her body still had goosebumps.</p>

<p>I guess she even had a hard time on the short(?) way from the car to the school entrance ;-). What happened after the dance? Did you have the opportunity to walk her home, or hug and kiss her goodbye in front of her house?</p>

<p>->This is the one instance where she was bare even outside, it had not happened since, but how does this compare to your experiences?</p>

<p>Too bad, but if she did it once, maybe she will do it again if you promise to warm her up afterwards? :-)</p>

<p>Hi lissy,</p>

<p>Yea, I have gotta a chill on my bladder. It feels kinda weird but yep, I continue sitting with bare thighs and buttocks until I have to go :) And yea, I am trying to maintain 105 lbs. I usually jump back to 110 during the summer though due to less exercise (shivering haha). I think my skin type just doesn't permit huge goosebumps, during the summer, it's usually really smooth (which I like).</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>Thank you so much!! :) I've always thought my girlfriend is really attractive, she has very nice features and a slim, petite figure. However her coldness intolerance is what makes her especially sexy. No matter where we go she will be cold at some point. She gets goosebumps really easily and chatters her teeth a lot. So you are from NYC? I go to college in Philadelphia so not too far so I understand the weather of that north eastern USA!! :) </p>

<p>So tell me how often would you say you have goosebumps? Do you get them so easily if you're just mildly cold and have a short sleeved shirt on they are all over or after a shiver or when? Also do you get more intense goosebumps in certain areas? Like do you get bigger goosebumps on your arms or back or legs? </p>

<p>Do you also enjoy chattering teeth? Even though goosebumps is my biggest fetish I love chattering teeth as well because they are usually together! I love it when girls don't even try to suppress their chattering teeth, and accentuate it. Does this happen to you a lot?</p>

<p>Thanks so much! I love hearing from you!</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,</p>

<p>Thank you so much!! :) She really is beautiful, she's young but beautiful, and very mature. She is extremely conservative and really is conscious about modesty, which I do respect but sometimes I do wish she was a bit looser! ;) Like she wears these see through lace outfits over her regular jeans and such that have just a tank top underneath. I can see the tank top and basically it does nothing to warm her on her arms despite covering them because they're thin, see-through lace. But she still won't take off the shirt even though she has a tank top still, despite adding no warmth.</p>

<p>Since you said you don't have a lot of hair but you have big goosebumps that must be unbelievably sexy! :) I love feeling skin with lots of goosebumps all over even if you feel mostly hair, but if you can accomplish big, sexy goosebumps and almost no hair that's unbelievable! :) I was wondering do you get turned on by your own goosebumps? </p>

<p>She wanted  to keep the coat in the car mostly because she figured it'd be a short walk and she didn't want to hang onto it all evening, so she said, but I have a feeling she did want to "Freeze" for me a bit! :) She's sweet like that! She calls me her "human space heater"</p>

<p>After the dance we went back to her house and spent some time in our favorite place, her basement. It's nicely renovated, quiet, and very cold! :p She just had on her strapless dress and spent most of our time trying to suppress her chattering teeth and shivering body which was apparent by the golf ball sized goosebumps all over her arms and legs and the nipples poking out. </p>

<p>Thank you Lissy for your comments and questions, I love hearing from you and your stories! :) Do you recall the time where you had the best goosebumps ever? When and where was it?</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>Yea, when I first started wearing mini skirts and tank tops during the winter, I was very intolerant to the cold so I would be shivering and chattering my teeth almost the entire day. My cold tolerance has built up pretty well now. However, due to my thin figure and lack of body hair, I still get cold easily. I usually start getting goosebumps when the temperature gets near 60F. Since I never cover my arms or legs no matter how cold I get, I'm basically covered with goosebumps most of the time during the winter. I usually get more goosebumps on my upper arm and thighs more than the rest of my body. And yes, I do enjoy chattering teeth, my teeth usually starts chattering when I am outside for about 10 or more minutes in freezing weather. I usually try to suppress my shivering and chattering teeth though to appear less cold unless if my bf tells me to shiver and chatter it all out :)
btw, Which college do you go to?</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>Wow this is truly remarkable!! :) Wow, how long have you been wearing mini skirts and tank tops during the winter? I'm just curious what sparked the change? Maybe one day when you were in high school, college or even older or younger you just decided to freeze for sexiness? :p This is quite amazing though! My gf probably gets chattering teeth easier than most. She'll chatter her teeth inside a 68 degree room wearing a long-sleeved shirt, and certainly with a short see through dress like she's been wearing lately. She mostly gets goosebumps though which are my favorite! I like the sound of chattering teeth, and it definitely is sexy to me, especially if there's stuttering going on, but nothing beats goosebumps! :)</p>

<p>So you are probably getting goosebumps almost all the time with the winter we've been having so far! Do you have goosebumps now while you're reading this? ;) Haha, I don't know if this is strange but certain areas of the body covered in goosebumps I like more than others. My favorite place is the upper arms. I don't know why but if the upper arm and the forearm are coated in intense goosebumps that is the ultimate appeal to me. I actually didn't care that much about leg, back, or breast goosebumps until recently. Still they don't do it as much for me as arms. But now i really like goosebumps on the breast area and the thigh too. But the arms, especially the upper arms are my favorite place!</p>

<p>Being from a relatively cold area I recall being in high school and knowing a girl who would always wear mini skirts and tank tops no matter what as well. She also had long, blond hairs all over her arms. I remember when she would get super cold, every single hair would stand out like 2 inches and a huge goosebump, bigger than i've ever seen would rise all over every single millimeter of skin. </p>

<p>Btw, I go to Temple University, I'm just curious and I've been wondering this for a while and I apologize if this is a stupid question, do you personally get turned on by goosebumps? Or is this something you do just for the pleasure of the men around you, or does this stimulate you as well?</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>I have been wearing miniskirts and tank tops during winter for almost 3 years now :) I started due to the encouragement of my bf. One Christmas, he got me really sexy clothes and I decided to surprise him by wearing them out on a date (I already knew he had a cold fetish). I was absolutely freezing every part of my body that night as it was snowing and we were outside for almost half an hour after dinner. I realized how much my bf liked seeing me shiver and chatter my teeth and I enjoyed feeling cold on my skin too :) </p>

<p>And wow, your gf does get goosebumps and chattering teeth really easy. Right now, my house is 65 degrees and I'm wearing a backless tank top and short shorts so yes, I am pretty cold and I have some goosebumps on my upper arms and thighs :) My bf likes goosebumps on my thighs more than anywhere else. He always has his hands on my cold thin thighs when we sleep at night lol I don't get a lot of goosebumps on my upper back though because I have long hair (from my head not body hair lol) covering it so that part of my body is probably the warmest. My nipples are always sticking out through my thin tank tops and my bf really likes that too :)</p>

<p>And lol the girl in your high school sounds pretty similar to me :) except I don't have much hair on my body to stick up lol</p>

<p>And yes, I get turned on by my own goosebumps, I love the feeling of it! However, I'm sure my bf loves it a lot more than me though, he even asked if he could lick my goosebumps once and he said it felt nice and cold on his tongue lol </p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>Haha I do find that really interesting! Well you said you get especially big and intense goosebumps on your thighs as well right? My gf actually has a minor skin disorder she is really embarrassed about that makes her thighs feel like she has goosebumps all the time no matter what. Since nobody knows about my cold fetish, not even really her (although I think she's getting the idea by now) she still doesn't understand why i don't mind that! ;) But we spent out first night together on new years eve into new years day and I was definitely the same way except for I had my hand on her upper arm! :) Do you get colder at night usually? </p>

<p>Haha I can't say that I have ever "licked" her goosebumps but I've kissed them and i do enjoy the cold, bumpy skin feeling! She did mention though that because she gets so intense goosebumps, they actually hurt after a while. Does this happen to you? I do admit they are really intense, because whenever I rub them when she has the most goosebumps my fingers aways feel tingly after! :)</p>

<p>And what the heck, one more incident that happened recently! :)</p>

<p>We were going to my friend's house for new years eve just a few days ago and his house is ALWAYS warm, like 80 degrees except for his porch which is like going outside which at that time was about 10 degrees. My gf decided to dress for the warm indoor temp increased by the many people in a small space and the hot food being prepared in the kitchen. She wore a short yet modest dress and a tank top covered by a veil-like see through top that the sleeves went to just above her elbow. I started to get really warm because I'm always warm so she suggested we go to porch to "cool off" which was dark, and freezing cold. We stepped outside and i really couldn't see but i heard this fast, clicking sound which I quickly identified as her chattering teeth the second we got out there. I told her to come close, and she buried herself in my arms. I was expecting to feel a lacey texture of her top, but I felt an extremely, rough, bumpy surface all over, and I was confused. I quickly realized she took off her top and was standing here with me in just her tank top and her mini skirt and tights. She was trying so hard not to shiver too much, but a huge shudder went through her body, I actually felt the shudder, and the most intense goosebumps I ever felt rose up all over her body in ever since inch of her skin, especially her upper arms and forearms. And the loudest shivering and chattering teeth broke the silence. </p>

<p>We went back inside in about 3 minutes that's all she could take. I don't know maybe in a couple years she'll be like you guys! :)</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>yea I get goosebumps all over my body lol Sometimes, my arms and legs hurt from getting too much wind and shivering too much. In that case, I usually just shiver myself to sleep and when I wake up, the pain is usually gone. 
I liked your story :) It's good to see your gf experiencing the shivering and chattering teeth. And yes, I do get colder at night especially when I'm outside. 
Your gf sounds really cute and sexy. Your gf should try staying outside a while longer. That is the only way she could get used to it. 
I know your gf cares about modesty outside. Does she dress in minimal clothes at home when no one is around but just you two? My sister is also concerned about being modesty and thinks that people will think she's crazy if they see her shivering intensely outside but she always wears tank tops and short shorts at home though. </p>

<p>Hi winter,</p>

<p>sorry, I don't understand German. I only know English and Korean.</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>I'm glad you enjoy my stories! :) I enjoy writing them, shall I continue? Because I have several more stories of similar type incidents? She's very young, still in high school, but very mature for her age. Many mistaken her for a college student. Thank you for your kind words and advice! She is concerned about modesty all around whether she's with just me or out in public, because she is really a huge believer in abstinence until marriage, which I respect. Even though we both obviously have major feelings for each other physically we choose to suppress them until the day we are married if it comes to that, so modesty is a way of "easing the temptations" as she puts it. But lately she's been wearing a lot of tank tops and a lace see-through top and a skirt that goes down to about mid-thigh and leggings underneath. So your sister enjoys the goosebumps and shivering as well? Is she younger or older? And what are her goosebumps like?</p>

<p>I'm just curious, what was your coldest moment? The time you had the most and biggest goosebumps, unbearably chattering teeth, shivering like crazy, do you have a favorite story about that?</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>sorry I'm kinda busy today and my story for the coldest moment is pretty long so I'll write it here in a few days.</p>

<p>I'm glad your gf is wearing tank tops annd skirts more often :) My sister is 3 years younger than me. I got her interested in wearing minimal clothes (story goes along with coldest moment story so you'll learn more when I write that). Anyways, my sister does enjoy goosebumps and shivering as well and she is very thin as well. However, she is much more shy compared to me so she doesn't like the added attention in college and on the street (like I enjoy people seeing my thin figure with barely any clothes on from far away, my sister is scared of that. Her goosebumps are almost identical to mine (we're sisters lol) except she gets cold a bit easier due to less experience. I'm trying to get her to wear tank tops and miniskirts outside, hopefully one day soon she will learn to enjoy the fun and excitement :)</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>I very much look forward to hearing your story! :) I'm guessing your sister doesn't have a lot of arm hair either? So her goosebumps are like you said, identical? But you said she gets cold a bit easier so she probably gets goosebumps much more then? Haha but if I recall correctly you said something about getting goosebumps most of the time, so she probably has them all the time, lol. That's really cool though. Is she in NYC as well? If you don't mind me asking what college does she attend? It sounds like she is very similar to my gf. My gf doesn't like the added attention and is very shy as well</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,</p>

<p>The story will come soon don't worry :) My sister always wears tank tops and miniskirts at home so yea she does have goosebumps all the time. Besides, we rarely put the heat on so our house gets pretty cold :) My sister enjoys shivering but she said she's scared to wear such revealing clothing to college. She does wear miniskirts during the fall summer and spring though but they are usually longer than what I wear. She wears like 12-15 inches while I wear 8-10 inches lol so yea I guess she's afraid ppl see her butt or something. And btw, she goes to Fordham :) And yea she is similar to your gf.</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>I feel like there hasn't been a lot of activity on here recently, so I will try to generate something! :) She always wears tank tops and miniskirts, so she has goosebumps all the time? Wow, that's really something! I've always dreamed about what it would be like to have a girl who not only gets cold easily and gets goosebumps easily, but shows it a lot! So she seems comfortable doing that around you at home, but not in public? That's ok, i can imagine. My gf doesn't like the attention of that, she really doesn't like attention on her much at all. Does her teeth chatter easily? That is probably the sexiest form of shivering. I mean, body shaking, is one thing but something about the sound of teeth chattering and stuttering is really amazing! Another thing that really gets me is when a girl gets a cold shiver and shudders all of a sudden, teeth chatter a little and goosebumps cover the arms all over. </p>

<p>Your sister sounds like a very attractive girl, and very sexy as well. Am I the only person who finds it interesting to compare goosebumps? lol. I love when you can see the tiny hairs sticking out of each one, and they are so perfectly bumpy and sexy. </p>

<p>Hi DaeWong Kim,</p>

<p>Welcome back! I was afraid this forum died lol
My sister and I both wear tank tops and miniskirts all the time, the only difference is I wear them outside in public too while she tends to put on a jacket and leggings. My sister is not as used to to cold as I am so her skin is always cold and has more goosebumps when we are home. I usually just have some goosebumps but don't shiver because 60*F is nothing for me lol My sister shivers and gets chattering teeth in the morning when she wakes up sometimes :) </p>

<p>And yes, my sister is very attractive, she has many guys that like her lol If it wasn't for my hair which I dyed brown and my minimal clothing, ppl wouldn't be able to tell the difference between me and my sister since we are both very tall and thin and have similar faces. </p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>I was afraid of the same thing! Good to hear from you too! Wow, that is really sexy I must say! So just because of the temperature you get goosebumps but aren't really shivering, where she's more covered in goosebumps, shivering chattering teeth etc? Ok, I see. So do both of you take cold showers too? Do you especially like the feeling of wet goosebumps? I would imagine one would a shower and walk out of the bathroom covered in goosebumps all over? That is probably the ultimate feeling, is the feeling of goosebumps right after a shower. If I may also ask a rather personal question you don't have to answer but do both of you get hard nipples easily too? That's the other really sexy part of cold. My gf not only gets goosebumps easily but also gets cold, hard nipples easily too, to the point where I can see them poking through her bra and her shirt as clear as day. The feeling of goosebumps all over arms and the poking of a cold nipple add to it. </p>

<p>Also, it appears to be mostly just you and me right now on this forum. Would you be interested in also continuing this conversation on facebook or e-mail? </p>

<p>Hi, thought we could do with a new story:
I walk into my house there is a light snow storm outside, me and you have been dating for about a year, I enjoyed being with you for a really long while until you moved into my house. The house as usual was a mess, and you were there just laying in front of the tv doing nothing. You stand up and say "hi honey how was work". I say "fine" I see you havent done anything today. My anger rises up a little, things are going to change from now on. I want you to get completely nude for me, you are going to be an obedient house pet who cleans and does what she is told or you are going out on the street. You are hesitant but don't really know what to do. I then wrap a leash and collar around your neck. We are going to go outside. You try to hold your ground stating it is way too cold to go out there in nothing. I ignore and pull you a little harder. We then walk out and I walk you from the front to the back you leaving small hand and knee prints on the snow. I continue to see your cute little body get redder and redder, your body is trembling from the cold. I find a large area of snow, unhook your collar and throw a ball. Go get it girl, you run after it doing anything to make your body warmer it has little affect, we keep doing this about 5 more times until I grow tired of it. I grab the leash and clip it back onto you and tie it to the tree. I leave with out a word for ten minutes pouring myself some coffee and making some cocoa for you. I put it in a bowl and go get you. I see you are running around just trying to get warm and also $%!@ing too like crazy, I pull you off and run you to the inside and tell you there is a bowl of cocoa for you you run to it lapping it up without any care, good puppy, you then grab onto me slightly humping my leg but getting you warm is your biggest goal I rub your head and watch you shiver until you finally get warm, I think I am going to like this I say to myself, pouring you another bowl of cocoa.</p>

<p>Hi Chilly!</p>

<p>It's been very cold in NY lately but I've been holding up, I currently have a cold right now but that's not stopping me! </p>

<p>Last Friday, during the blizzard, I had to run an errand in the middle of the blizzard and since my wardrobe only contained paper thin tank tops and miniskirts, I had no choice but to freeze and get hit by heavy rain! The moment I walked outside, my entire body was shivering and it was so cold, I got numb really quick. And that was actually a good thing because my thin bare arms and legs were so numb, I could barely feel the pain from the heavy rain/hail/snow falling on me! I remember multiple people stopped by and asked if I needed a jacket or something and I just said "no thank you but you should take yours off anyways" lol</p>

<p>I remember I was still shivering for like over an hour in my room after coming back from the blizzard even though my room was like 60F. </p>

<p>I am truly enjoying this winter, it feels so nice to go bare arms and bare legs in the freezing cold :) Now, I got so used to exposing my skin that a few days ago, when I had to wear formal clothes to a meeting, there was this weird feeling. Like idk, I get used to seeing my own goosebumps and shivering and for that hour, I really missed it lol</p>

<p>Hey gfx, is so good to have you back!! </p>

<p>haha so you probably have constant goosebumps now I would imagine? You said you have a cold, so I was wondering if you are sick do you actually feel colder? Like I know people who when they have a cold even if no fever just inevitably feel colder. Like do you get chills/shivers and thus goosebumps and chattering teeth more now? Because i know when some people get sick they shiver harder and their teeth chatter louder.</p>

<p>Great to hear from you again!</p>

<p>Hey Daewong Kim, good to have you back too!</p>

<p>And yes, I have constant goosebumps now. I feel a lot colder when I am sick lol I've been shivering even in my house for the past week. Normally, I don't shiver until the temperature is under 50F but this week, I've been shivering even when its 60F and I think I would still be shivering if it was 70F. Both my bf and my sister said my arms and legs felt ice cold this week. In fact, I was shivering so much, I got even thinner (went from 110 to 106lbs) :D Shivering is the most healthy way to lose weight!</p>

<p>I almost needed to wear warmer clothes when I went outside and I wanted to but when I opened my wardrobe, I realized I was out of luck lol So I basically walked like half an hour in a paper thin midriff tank top and a 10 in. miniskirt to the doctor. By the time I got there, I was shivering, chattering, sneezing, and coughing like crazy and all the patients gave me this awkward stare lol The doctor kept saying I needed to wear more clothes but me and my bf both told him that I was used to the cold and told him I was training for a cold contest (not true). </p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>wow that sounds amazing!!! haha!! You are one amazing girl!! :) How do you stand it though? I mean to have the constant feeling of goosebumps on your arms and legs, does it ever get to the point where you have such intense goosebumps that they actually start to hurt? Because my girlfriend says that happens to her a lot but she has quite a bit of arm hair so when she gets goosebumps they're huge and extremely intense. Like when I touch her arms it doesn't even feel like skin it's so intense. Also when you say you're constantly shivering is this like just shaking and shuddering or are you teeth chattering constantly too? Haha well I hope you feel better but i must say this is one of your sexiest stories yet! Like how long have you been having these chills? And to keep from covering up even when you're chilled is really amazing! I'm sure you're shivering even harder than usual! </p>

<p>@gfx: You are wonderful! I'm still waiting for your "coldest hour" story too. Mine was a couple of weeks ago when I went for my usual morning run with a heavy frost. The field I run across was mainly ice which kept cracking under my feet and I kept losing my flip-flops (I don't go barefoot in ice like this as I've cut my feet before when I have). I swam in the river for ten minutes as usual and came out shaking. I plodded across the frozen field in my wet shorts and vest (I never take a towel). It was more and more effort to run or even walk and more than once I thought I might just collapse in the frost. But somehow I made it home where I had my usual cold shower. I was shaking all the way to work (an hour's drive) but I felt great!</p>

<p>Sometimes I find that I get so cold I need to get warm but the moment I cover my legs or turn up the car heating (to like 16C/62F, the minimum setting above just plain cold) I feel this strange repulsive feeling and I have to uncover my legs again or turn off the heating and open the windows. Then I get colder still but it feels so much better. The last few days I had to drive three hours north, where I knew it would be freezing, to train some customers. I took no coat or jacket or anything long-sleeved. So first thing in the morning I left the car in the hotel and walked across town in a short-sleeved shirt for half an hour with ice on the ground to my customer's place. I got lots of strange looks from people wrapped in down jackets, with hats and gloves on. The sun was shining and I enjoyed this wonderfully fresh cold morning. My customers asked me if I had a coat - I told them I'd left it in my own car and forgotten to transfer it to the hire car we have to use for long trips.  On the long cold journey home I had the windows open most of the time with the icy wind blasting in. At least I never felt tired.</p>

<p>@potdem: That's cold! At what temperature will you start baring your arms too? I usually go with short sleeves or sleeveless down to about 0C (32F). Below that I would need gloves at least. I may wear o sleeveless body warmer below about 7C (45F), otherwise just a T-shirt. I suppose it depends ok the weather: rain and wind can make it feel a lot colder when in fact it's warmer. When it's calm and sunny it almost doesn't matter how cold it is.</p>

<p>@ &lt;3shivering: It's all on p54. I kept going throughout the winter. The air may have warmed up now but the river is still numbingly cold.</p>

<p>@gfx: Inspired by you I have now got rid of everything long-sleeved so I will have no choice but to shiver through next winter.</p>

<p>Spring has finally arrived in the UK now and it's starting to warm up but wild swimming is the best way to chill.</p>

<p>Hope this thread hasn't died. Just perhaps hibernating for the summer?</p>

<p>@wildswimmer: I'm glad to hear that I have been an inspiration to someone! :) Pardon me from asking, but are you a guy or girl? If you're a girl, all you should wear are tank tops and mini skirts! And if you're a guy, just wear t-shirts and shorts :)</p>

<p>Hello I'm new here my name is Joseph</p>

<p>I have a PDF of some Photoshopped shivering girls I made myself</p>

<p>https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3G8VtNh5uu_YVRTck5IMEI1VmM/edit?usp=sharing</p>

<p>Can someone post pictures of either themselves (if youre a girl) or your girlfriends shivering in skimpy clothes (T shirt and miniskirt no stockings, no leg warmers, no scarf, no hat)</p>

<p>perhaps arms crossed and nice winter background</p>

<p>or videos
iluvshiveringirls@gmail.com</p>

<p>its hard to find girls willing to do this</p>

<p>hi
A few years back I dated this guy.  It seemed his mission in live was to make me a cold a possible. WHen we 1st started to see eachother he would ask me to where skirts and dresses in the cold.  when we moved in together is when it got hard.  I moved in early winter and he wanted me nude the whole time home.  he kept the heat only at 50 degrees.  Our yard was fenced in and we would spend a lot of time out there no matter how cold it got.  There was 1 time he had me in the back yard it was down pouring rain and 35 degrees out naked!  he watched from a window and kepted me out there for half an hour the wind was so hard and the rain felt like needles I shivered so hard when he finally let me in the cold house I just layed on the cold hard wood floor shivering for hours.</p>

<p>Welcome to the thread!! This sounds like a fantastic story! Do you enjoy being cold? Or was it miserable for you? Also do you get cold with goosebumps easily to begin with? I would imagine you'd almost be constantly covered in goosebumps the whole time with that situation. Glad to have you join us!</p>

<p>I enjoy being cold. some days I reached my breaking point and it was miserable.  I get goosebumps very easily. I was with him for 4 years.  I was covered in goosebumps the almost the whole time. It was crazy the things I did.  I remember 1 time during a blizzard with wind gusts up to 30mph and wet heavy snow I stood on our deck until I couldn't stand anymore he had to carry me in the house every gust of wind made me shiver harder and my skin was so cold the snow stopped melting off.  He watched through the patio door.  My skin was a bright red from the wind and snow my hair soaking wet and turning to ice when he carried me in I was laying in about a foot of snow half numb and shivering so hard once in the house I didn't dry off (that was 1 of the rules) he told me when he fell asleep 3 hours later I was still cold to touch and shivering uncontrolablly.  </p>

<p>Wow, that is really something! Now I noticed favorably that goosebumps is your screen name. I'm curious as to why you chose that? I have been with a beautiful girl for nearly two years now, and she has to be the world's most cold sensitive person. She knows that I am without fail turned on by shivering, goosebumps etc. and she does a lot to accommodate for that despite her cold intolerance. However I could never see myself pushing like your boyfriend did. I love the sound of chattering teeth, and seeing the body shaking, however goosebumps will always be my favorite which is why I was glad to see that as your screen name.</p>

<p>For me the feeling of goosebumps is the most amazing feeling in the world. If you don't mind me asking I have a few questions for you. First, do you have a lot of hair on your arms so are your goosebumps really big? Also, do you like the feeling of your own goosebumps? Also, do you get goosebumps more in a certain area? Like on your forearms, upper arms, legs etc. Also do your teeth chatter a lot? </p>

<p>I have big goosebumps and they cover me evenly. I love the feeling of them I don't have a lot of hair on arms.  When I shiver my teeth chatter a lot. When we were together I didn't have any winter clothes. I mainly wore short sleeveless dresses mini skirts and tank tops short cut off shorts and bikinis.  For shoes I had a couple pairs of open toed heels and flip flops.When it would snow I would shovel the walk in just a bikini and flip flops I got a lot of weird looks as I shivered the whole time but it was fun it usually took an hour to shovel but it was always my chore no matter how cold it it got.  Being cold became such I turn on for me</p>

<p>cool! that sounds really incredible! the feeling of goosebumps is just the sexiest thing ever! And i'm sure with the short sleeveless dresses there were a lot of them all the time! When you said you get goosebumps easily are we talking like 50s or 60s? Do you have goosebumps rights now? My girlfriend could be sitting inside a 70 degree room with a short sleeved shirt on, get a shiver and have goosebumps all over her arms and start chattering her teeth. She has quite a bit of hair on her arms so when she gets goosebumps they are enormous but unbelievably sexy!</p>

<p>Do you happen to have any videos or pictures of you shivering with goosebumps? </p>

<p>There is this guy, he post videos of himself shivering on youtube:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nLY-O1Css</p>

<p>there is another guy who does the same, but he takes them down
again after a few days, probably because of privacy reasons.</p>

<p>it would be great if some of you shiver-lovers, who love to shiver themselves, be willing to post some videos (please put the camera on a tripod or something, so that it is steady). </p>

<p>just an idea.</p>

<p>Every Sunday night we would go wash the car.  I was to wear only bikini top and mini skirt all my skirts just covered my butt.  I would also go bare foot.  He loved it more when I was covered in goosebumps shivering and wet.  Being wet adds to the cold and its what can make it miserable. During these car washes he would control the house and I would scrub the car.  We would go to a car wash place. we didn't do it at home.  While spraying the car he made sure to spray me until I was soaked. My bikini top I wore was white so it became really see through.  The car wash place was open all year so no matter how cold it got we were there and it was freezing.  Some days were to much to handle id shiver non stop the whole time with teeth chattering so hard I thought they would break.  When we finished we would head back home no heat allowed in car and id still be wet. not allowed to dry.  </p>

<p>When summer would come I thought I get a break but he would find ways to keep me cold all year.</p>

<p>As hard as it was to sometimes do.  Freezing made me feel beautiful because of how much he liked it and I grew to like it myself and yes I have goosebumps now</p>

<p>Also, just out of curiosity, at what temp did the shivering become uncontrollable?</p>

<p>Wow you are quite a trooper! So even though it made you so miserable you still endured it? That's quite amazing! I can imagine how being wet would make you colder. How often would he make you wet? I know that when my girlfriend and I go swimming she gets so much colder easier. She'll shiver harder, her teeth will chatter louder and her goosebumps are even bigger. She has quite a bit of hair on her arms though so I love it when she gets the huge goosebumps and the hair sticks out over an inch especially on her forearms. </p>

<p>I'm curious as to what did he do when you were sick and had chills? I know that if you're sick people tend to get colder easier. If you had shivers and chills with a fever did he still make you freeze? Did you get bigger goosebumps or shiver louder?</p>

<p>In summer we used a lot of ice. Ice cubes at first but he started to make bigger pieces to last longer. cold showers and ice baths with fans blowing on me.  A/c cranked all the time. about a year in to our relation ship we built our "freeze room" for summer but that's another story</p>

<p>1 time at a hotel he dumped 2 bags of ice in tub and had shower head spraying cold water.  the tub was in view of the tv so I was to stay in there as we watched a movie.  he brought 2 big fans with and had them full blast on my.  I was shivering instantly.  I could only sit on the ice so long before having to stand under the shower head when my hair got wet the chattering teeth started.  I switched from standing and sitting a few times during movie.  my skin was bright red soaked and covered in goosebumps. as ice melted in tub he would add more to make sure I continued to freeze.</p>

<p>Shivering got uncontrollable below freezing the wetter I was and the longer out side the more uncontrollable it got with intense chattering teeth.</p>

<p>I was wet alot.  Id have to start me day with a cold shower and then outside for a smoke. Not being able to dry.  That would get the shivering started right away.  After breakfast we would go for a hour long walk id wear heels with a small dress. My hair would still be damp half way through the walk is when it would start to get miserable with huge goosebumps and uncontrollable shivering.  My only real warmth in winter was in bed or if we were in a store or another building.</p>

<p>When I would get sick I could take warm showers and spend more time under the blankets in bed and no being outside wet.  Other then that everything stayed same.  id still be nude at home and smoke outside that way.  if we went somewhere I didn't have warm clothes so id freeze.  and with a fever the cold feels much colder and the shivering is more intense.</p>

<p>I think I got all your questions answered :) thanks for your interest.  what types of stories do you wanna hear im sure if you can think of it he had me do something similer</p>

<p>Thank you for posting!! :) I always thought my cold fetish was kinda weird, I don't really tell people about it. I just told my girlfriend about it a few months ago and we've been dating for years. She's really not to terribly strong when it comes to cold and as turned on as I get while she is I hate it when she's that uncomfortable.</p>

<p>She usually wears a short sleeved shirt of some kind all year round for me and rarely covers up. She gets goosebumps a lot, but it's pretty easy to make them happen. All I need to do is roll up her shirt from the bottom so her mid section is exposed and run my hands down her back and she'll be covered almost instantly without fail. Also if she drinks ice water and we go into the basement she'll start chattering her teeth instantly as well.</p>

<p>Your stories are fantastic! I love reading every one of them! Because I am especially turned on by goosebumps specifically anything having to do with lots of goosebumps. How do yours feel? I'm guessing you have them right now. I especially love it when you can feel the hairs sticking out as you feel the bumps themselves. Also when a girl is wet and has huge goosebumps and the water droplets collect in the hairs that is also really sexy to me!</p>

<p>I'm kind of curious about the whole sick thing. So if you have a fever and have shivers and chills do you have goosebumps too? This is actually a story of a friend of mine that I really like if you don't mind me sharing.</p>

<p>One of my best friends over Christmas was pretty sick. She had a fever of 104-105 for 2 days. Her main symptom was severe shaking chills. I went over to her house and hung out with her a bit. She is a beautiful blonde girl built firm as she is an athlete and has long sexy blonde hairs on her arms. I went over to her apartment and she greeted me, she was wearing a short sleeved shirt and shorts. She had a blanket wrapped around her. We sat down and talked for a bit. She said she was sick and had a high fever. I kind of have a bad habit of staring down when people talk to focus on their arms if they are bare but in a very subtle way. I noticed that during the conversation all of a sudden HUGE goosebumps appeared all over. She didn't say anything but they kept getting more and more intense looking. Finally she said she was freezing but didn't want to cover up because of the fever. Her teeth started chattering so loud, and I've to this day never seen goosebumps that big. She said she got goosebumps with the slightest temperature change and has never felt that cold in her whole life. </p>

<p>When you have a fever you said that the cold feels much colder and the shivering is more intense. Does your boyfriend or former boyfriend like to exploit that? </p>

<p>he would exploit the shivering when I was sick,  The goosebumps were bigger and I could tell he loved it even though I was miserable.  the 1st time I got sick with a bad fever we didn't know. I woke up with intense shivering and went for my morning cold shower.  he watched as I shivered so bad and the goosebumps were so large we went out for a smoke and I shivered so hard I ended up curling up on ground shakeing.  I layed in bed a while after that shakeing the whole time.  I would still go out nude to smoke and that mad it worse but he enjoyed it so much I toughed it out for him.  after that day is when we changed the rules while sick because he didn't want me to get extremely ill since I had no limits.</p>

<p>Hmm that sounds very interesting actually. I heard somewhere that taking a cold shower is supposed to help break the fever. I suggested that to my friend unfortunately she said she was too cold to even think about it. Most of my female friends are always cold, but it's interesting because they show it differently. I have a friend who to this day I have never seen her get goosebumps. She will say she is absolutely freezing, will be rubbing her arms and sometimes even her teeth will be chattering and she'll be wearing a tank top but no goosebumps. I have another friend who is almost constantly covered in goosebumps even if she claims she's not cold. Usually I see goosebumps before teeth start chattering but they both are really sexy. I love the sound of teeth chattering especially if a girl is not trying to hide it. I have a friend who intentionally tries to make her teeth chatter as loudly as she can shivering extremely loudly, likewise I have a friend whom I swear owns nothing but sleeveless and short sleeved tops yet whenever I see her arms are crossed, goosebumps are all over and she says she's either cold or freezing. </p>

<p>What is your favorite part about the whole cold, goosebumps, or shivering process and do you have other stories about specifically goosebumps? Like what was the time that you have the worst case of goosebumps ever? How big were they, how did they feel, how did you feel?</p>

<p>Wow you really are tough to keep freezing so long even when you were sick. You mentioned you have a 'freezing room' for the winter, what is that? And if you're ok with sharing stories of what your boyfriend had you do, what sort of things has he had you do in public? Like did he make you go out at night wearing very little in the winter?

<p>The freezing room was for summer we installed a walk in freezer in the basement the im not sure how cold it was set but it was cold I would be in there a lot.   intense shivering huge goosebumps and what was the biggest shock was going in because outside temp was in 80s.  some times he would stray down with a water hose as I stood there shivering.  Some times he would keep me in there over an hour id be shivering so bad and half numb. id get funny looks from people when I would go outside in the heat and just sit there shivering so hard it hurt with huge goosebumps.</p>

<p>My coldest experience we took a 10 min walk to the lake by our house temp was below 0 f the lake has high salt content so doesn't freeze.  I had to go for a swim the water just stung my whole body it was definitely the biggest goosebumps I had and the worst I shivered I only lasted about 2 minutes before crawling out the wind blew so hard it froze me to the core the walk home was pure torture dripping wet.  my hair was completely froze. I got pretty sick the next day but was so proud I did it</p>

<p>What I loved the most about goosebumps was them getting rubbed it made the goosebumps and shivering more intense it was an amazing feeling.</p>

<p>We did a lot of public things.  I remember at 1st being so cold and embarrassed walking around in a short dress while in boots and a coat when temp was in the 30s but within a year id walk around in a bikini bare foot with temp around 0 I just loved the feeling it made me feel so beautiful and turned me on so much.</p>

<p>the thing I loved most about being cold was trying to hold back the shivering and chattering teeth which made it worse lol.  and I loved to walk around on a nice sunny day in the 20s in a tiny dress showing my goosebumps to the world as long as I wasn't wet id last for hours</p>

<p>The feeling of goosebumps is just amazing! I especially love goosebumps on arms. When my girlfriend gets goosebumps I like to start at the shoulder and gradually run my hand down her upper arm to her elbow and down her forearm. Her goosebumps are strongest on her forearms. She has more hair their so they're bigger and more intense. Her upper arms are bumpier but her forearms are hairier.</p>

<p>I figure there are three kinds of goosebumps I see. Which one would you say describes you?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They're mostly in brunette caucasian girls and asians. There is almost no hair involved so the goosebumps are completely skin. They're often small but they're really bumpy and often not as noticeable.</p></li>
<li><p>They're mostly in blonde caucasians. There is so much hair that the goosebumps are extremely noticeable because the hair stands up like 2 inches. These are the kind of goosebumps you can spot a mile away. But when you feel them, you mostly feel the hair.</p></li>
<li><p>My personal favorite, whenever I see these I can barely control myself! They're in a lot of different ethnicities but especially in light skinned hispanics, eastern europeans, and many blondes. This is where not only is there a lot of hair but a lot of skin as well. These goosebumps the hair sticks out over an inch but the bumps themselves are really prominent. So when you rub them you can feel the goosebumps as well as the hair which doubles the sexiness</p></li>

<p>@goosebumps:</p>

<p>Great experience you had there. Did you swim in the freezing cold lake again the next day when you were sick to break your fever? I also wear short  summer clothes all year no matter how cold it is. I just like to look a bit sexy ;-). Like you, I don't dry off after winter swimming or cover up when I am sick, however, I don't keep dry or shower warm then. Now and then I come down with a cold and fever, shivering, sneezing, and coughing, but who doesn't? That doesn't stop me from being wet and cold outside in little clothing. In fact, I rather enjoy it, and I have never become seriously ill. On the contrary, toughening it out improves your cold resistance. Did you get wet outside in cold weather involuntarily (e.g., being caught in the rain, hail, or snow) or deliberately on other occasions when you were sick? I think it is cool that you still smoke then ;-) What was your favorite experience when you were cold, wet, and shivering with fever?</p>

<p>Cheers,
Lissy</p>

<p>Yes we went ice skating many times some time nude some times bikini sometimes in a dress I cant ice skate well so I fell on the ice a lot.</p>

<p>My favorite time sick wet and freezing had to be.</p>

<p>I had a fever and shivering pretty bad I layed on our picnic table on my back and my body was rubbed down with snow as the cold wind blew on me. While on my back he rubbed me from head to toe until I was beat red covered in huge goosebumps shivering like made the melting snow soaked me.  he did this for about a half hour concentrating on my breasts and inner thighs that was so cold.  After the half hour we went inside a few minutes so he could warm up because even with his multiple layers of clothes the low temp got to him was he was warm even though I still shivered violently we went back out and I layed on my stomach as he rubbed the freezing snow over my goosebumped back butt and legs after another half hour he had me stand up I was shaking so bad I barely could stand and he dumped a bucket of water over my head I screamed in shock.  Once in the house I layed on the cold floor with 2 fans on me as he massaged my goosebumps as I shivered out of control.</p>

<p>I have huge goosebumps but not much body hair.</p>

<p>@goosebumps: It's really good to have someone else on this forum who enjoys being cold. There seem to be many guys on here who enjoy watching others (female) being cold or who enjoy reading about their cold adventures, but not so many who like being cold themselves, and fewer still who get turned on by it. Your adventures sound amazing - it must have been so nice to share them with someone, even though he didn't partake in the feelings. Your freezer room is a great idea - ice even in the summer! I'm looking forward to hearing more about your wonderfully cold exploits. Did you ever go skiing?</p>

<p>Before I discovered this forum I really thought I was a bit weird. Still now I've only ever told two people about my feelings and I don't see either of them now. People just think I don't feel the cold - of course I do, maybe not as much as most people but that's because I'm used to it now and it needs to be colder and colder now for me to actually feel cold. But if it's below 7C or so (what's that? 45F) I feel cold, but I don't cover up, because I like the feeling. So instead I actively seek out situations to make me cold, like my morning run and swim in the river, even in the winter, and never wearing long sleeves whatever the weather, and sleeping with the bedroom window open.</p>

<p>@lissy: It's good to have you back after a long silence. Like you I don't dry off after my morning swim in the cold river. I just run home again for a cold shower. I do sometimes wear flip-flops if it's frosty as I've cut my feet before on frosty ground, but otherwise go barefoot, even in soft snow.</p>

<p>@gfx: What I like about this forum is that you only have to reveal what you want to. No names, no photos, no more info than you want - and people use their imagination for the rest. I do only wear T-shirts and shorts, though I have to wear long trousers at work but then the aircon is on high there.</p>

<p>my first nude iceskating was a very cold experience </p>

<p>He suggested we go for a walk I was wearing a thin sundress temp was around 20 f sunny and a little breeze.  I said sure.  He asked if I would go bare foot with no coat. I never did that before but I agreed I been outside without coat and shoes before but not a long period of time yet.  We set off and right a way I was covered in goosebumps after a little bit I was shivering pretty hard. We headed into a wooded area which I had to walk barefoot in the snow this was my first time for that and it was a shock I though the side walk was cold but the snow was much colder I had to take several breaks to rub my feet.  After about 30 min about 10 on cement and 20 in the snow we got to a large river where there was no snow cover. He asked if id go ice skating I said I never had with my teeth chattering so hard. he pulled a pair of skates out of his back pack and asked me to try I was so relieved to have something on my feet.  he said 1 condition for the skates I had to give him my dress.  The dress was so short and thin it didn't offer any protection from the cold and wind and my feet were in such pain I agreed.  I was never nude in such cold before nor out in public so I was kind of embarrassed.</p>

<p>Out on the icy river I fell instantly hurt my butt so bad and the ice was so cold on my hands but I got up and tried again after falling I few times I started to get the hang of it I fell a bunch I imagine its hard to ice skate even when your good if your shivering non stop and your feet are numb.  After an hour on the ice my skin was completely red from the cold the wind and landing on the ice.  The sun was goin down and the wind was picking up iwas freezing so bad this was the coldest I had been at that point.  he called me to the bank where he watched and rubbed my shaking goosebumped covered body his hand felt so hot it was like fire on my skin.  he said before we head back I should go out 1 more time. I did.</p>

<p>we didn't know that with the current of the river there was thin spots in ice I went over 1 and broke right through and went in to my waste I screamed so loud the water was just 2 cold.  he helped me out.  I put my dress on my soaked freezing body and gave him the skates and we headed back.  I don't remember much of the walk back I was too cold and shock non stop the next morning I was very sick</p>

<p>@goosebumps:  Wow.  Was it just as cold/difficult all the other times you went ice skating nude, or did you have a little bit easier time staying on your feet (well, skates as it may be)?  I'd like to hear about it, and if you can manage it (or if you just want to) in a bit more detail.</p>

<p>On the subject of anonymity: It is pretty nice that people only find out what you want them to find out about you.  I use the same screen-name for everything, though, so if people want to find out about me, all they need to do is do a search for my screen-name.  Saves me the trouble of being social and telling them about myself.</p>

<p>I was sick with chills and fever and a cough.  I woke up multiple times that night shivering and still covered in goose bumps.  It felt amazing having goosebumps that long I thought they would never go away</p>

<p>Another time ice skating we went to a pond that was frozen over.  There was a light snow fall that night.  I got out of the car and took off me dress and heels. Sat on a log to put on the heels the snow on the log was cold on my bare butt and started the shivering right away as I put on the skates the falling snow melted on my body the cold water highlighted my goosebumps and made the show more.  I rubbed my legs the goosebumps felt wonderful.  I first got on the ice and went about 5 feet and fell landed on my knees hands slipped out and fell on my chest the fresh snow stuck to my body.  he had me skate over an hour I had little cuts on my hands knees butt and boobs from the sharp ice my skin was a bright red soaked and shaking the goosebumps made my skin so tight that was an awesome feeling,  I love that the most.  by the end of the skating I was starting to get the hang of it but was too cold tocontinue on. he had me remove my skates and run on the ice that was cold I rolled in the fresh snow a bit before getting dressed and heading home.  </p>

<p>what do you want me to go into detail with I don't understand </p>

<p>This adresses all our freezing ladies: Goosebumps, Lissy, Gfx, ...</p>

<p>Some of you already answered indirectly to some of these question within their stories.</p>

<p>When you wear skimpy dresses, does it only mean "not appropriate for the wheather" or really quite "revealing" and sexy? Wearing a short skirt and a T-shirt in winter is sexy already. But wearing micro skirts and short or even see-through tank-tops is something else. Do you were any bras or panties?
When you go out in public in your skimpy outfit, do do you only think about the temperature or also about how much you show? Did or does it still now cost you some effort to go out dressed like this besides freezing?</p>

<p>What kind of shoes do you wear with your outfit?</p>

<p>What do you wear when you are with your boyfriend, friends, family or at your job?</p>

<p>Do you take any special care for your figure?</p>

<p>Hello goosebumps,</p>

<p>do you still keep up with your minimal dressing after splitting with your boyfriend?</p>

<p>In your stories up to now you were only with your boyfriend. Did he ask you to dress minimally when you met with friends? Did he maybe ask you to show your stamina against cold when you were with his friends, e.g. for longer time as on a common trip?</p>

<p>i was expected to wear as little as possible in the cold all the time.  it didn't matter who we were with or where we went or how long we were out I was freezing.  very short skirts with tank tops.  or short jeanshorts very short sleeveless dresses I wore bikini out many times.</p>

<p>1 time we went on a snowmobile trip with a bunch of his friends everyone was wearing snow suits gloves boots and helmets.  I had on heels bikini top and my jean shorts.  It was  a rather cold day im glad I had a helmet to cover my head.  I was shivering intensly before we start I was sitting behind my boyfriend on the same snowmobile. </p>

<p>We rode for an hour before stopping fora smoke.  my skin was beat red and I had huge goosebumps. shaking so hard could barely hold my smoke.  His 4 friends looked at me in shock for doin this.  we headed out again the shivering was so hard I couldn't hold on and fell of in to the snow the whole trip lasted 4 hours it was 1 of my coldest expierences Im pretty sure I had mild hypothermia by the end;)</p>

<p>@goosebumps: I would like to hear your story too. I hope you won too. But it wasn't colder than your four hours on a snowmobile in only a bikini, surely? "Mild hypothermia"? I'm surprised you didn't get frostbite! How do you know it was only mild? What symptoms did you have? Had you stopped shivering completely?</p>

<p>Mild hypothermia:</p>

<p>symptoms: shivering, numb hands and other extremities and reduced manual dexterity. Complex skills such as skiing become more difficult, person may feel tired, may argue and become uncooperative.</p>

<p>Difficulty in performing tasks such as fastening up clothing, putting on gloves, a hat etc. or taking them out of a rucksack. A fall in core temperature of only 1Â°C can slow reaction times and impair judgment.</p>

<p>Moderate hypothermia:</p>

<p>This occurs when the core temperature falls below 35Â°C and results in violent shivering and a loss in muscular coordination. Walking becomes laborious and difficult with frequent stumbles, person may fall over.</p>

<p>Most dangerous of all at this stage is perhaps the loss of ability to make rational decisions. There may be a desire to lay down in the snow and sleep ... and even to remove clothing due to an unawareness of the cold.</p>

<p>Below 32Â°C (89.6Â°F) shivering stops as there is no energy left to keep it going, this causes the temperature to drop even further and more rapidly. Person eventually unable to walk will curl up on the ground completely unaware of others, unconsciousness comes at around 30Â°C (86Â°F).</p>

<p>The final stage is profound hypothermia:</p>

In this stage the body has effectively stopped trying to keep itself warm and some final steps are taken to avoid death. The heart rate and breathing slow so that they are hard to detect at all. Only or two breaths per minute may be taken. The skin is very pale and icy cold to the touch. The limbs are stiff, pupils dilate and are unreactive to light. To all intents and purposes the person appears to be dead, metabolism has slowed so far that they are almost in a state of suspended animation.

At a core temperature of around 28Â°C (82.4Â°F) heartbeat irregularities may occur - called cardiac arrhythmias - this can lead to an uncoordinated twitching of the heart muscle preventing it from pumping blood properly and so resulting in death. Even if this does not happen, the heart will stop beating completely at around 20Â°C (64.8Â°F) and causes death.


<p>this is from this website: 
http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/cold_hypothermia.htm</p>

<p>there are a lot of others. </p>

<p>if, one the other hand, you train yourself, so that you can endure cold a lot longer, then you don't shiver at all in the beginning. it takes you much longer to start to shiver and feel uncomfortable. you can, for example, google Wim Hof, known as the iceman.</p>

<p>@wildswimmer: yea the anonymity on here is nice.</p>

<p>@lissy w: welcome back my freezing friend :)</p>

<p>@ferfred:
I usually wear really short skirts (about 8 in.) and a paper thin tank top that could potentially be see-through if I am wet. I wear a bra and panties only when I'm outside of the house although sometimes, if I am not meeting anyone and just with my bf to go to somewhere nearby, I would go without those also. I think more about how attractive I look more than how cold I am although it is hard not to think of that when your entire body is freezing cold in the middle of winter. Since I normally dress like this inside and outside no matter how cold it is since I don't have any warm clothes, it doesn't take me much effort besides shivering and being freezing cold. My wardrobe does not have any skirt over 10 inches long or any shirt that covers any part of my arm so there is basically no way I'll ever be warm lol</p>

<p>I usually wear low high heels to work (since I'm already 5'10 and my bf doesn't want me to look taller than him) and sandals/flip flops at home and outside. </p>

<p>I tend to dress even less than usual when I am with my bf since I know he loves to feel my ice cold skin. I usually dress very sexy around my friends too because I want to be the one that looks the most attractive lol At one point, I used to wear like a light hoodie covering up my tank top when I'm with my family but gradually, my family are starting to accept my love for braving the cold. In fact, I am currently training my younger sister to dress like me and my bf has confiscated most of her clothes besides skirts and tank tops. I realized she gets cold a lot easier than I do though since I have been dressing minimally for so long and she is still afraid of going outside in a tank top when it is either raining, snowing, or windy although she has been wearing short skirts only for almost a year now.</p>

<p>And for the last question, not really, I am naturally very thin so all I have to do to stay that way is to keep shivering (since shivering is basically exercise) and eat healthy food lol My main focus is maintaining my 16 in. thigh</p>

<p>@mascorta: Yes, my favorite thing about wearing minimal clothes is the shock factor! I love the way you dress :) Try to get rid of the light jacket and the boots though to make your outfit even better. </p>

<p>@Wolfsbane: what's Callen's idea?</p>

<p>wow that was a sad story mascorta. I'm glad the guy saved your life though. That's why you should never go to a place far away alone without a way of getting home. Usually, when I'm out in minimal clothes, I'm with my bf who would make sure that my body is cold but safe from hypothermia. That's the one caution of wearing minimal clothes, you have to have everything planned out on how to get there and get back home.</p>

<p>I actually had a similar experience once where me and my bf were lost after a dinner party in Montreal. I was wearing nothing but a miniskirt and a paper thin tank top in below freezing and windy weather and we had to walk back to our hotel which was like half an hour away. The moment I stepped out of the restaurant, I was already shivering uncontrollably. My bf said that running might help me get a bit warmer so we ran and I slipped on something along the way. My bf caught me by a piece of my tank top which was so thin that it ripped off. Since my tank top was ripped and I basically didn't have any clothes on, he decided to lend me his jacket so we can make it back. I felt a lot less cold with the jacket on even though my legs were still entirely bare and turned bright red.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call it a sad story, gfx. </p>

<p>Actually in the very moment I suffered quite a lot, but I still remember with kindness the guy who picked me up. It might be weird, but recalling the memories doesn't at all feel sad - it was quite an extreme experience and as eventually everything went well I wouldn't like to have missed it.</p>

<p>I kinda get that - an experience which was pretty miserable at the time seems so different when you look back on it. I quite like it when I, or other people, give themselves up to the elements, by not taking warm clothes, or, like gfx, giving them all away, then going somewhere where you know the weather could turn much colder. I once hiked into the hills and camped by a high lake in wilderness. There was frost on my tent in the morning and I went for a swim in the freezing lake. Luckily I had my sleeping bag in which to curl up and shiver for half an hour afterwards. Then I had the long walk out and back down in my sleeveless top and shorts. Sure I did have the sleeping bag to curl up in in an emergency but even so it felt good. Later I heard there could be deep snow there at that time of the year.</p>

<p>Judging by those definitions I must have had mild and moderate hypothermia many times then. Most times in winter after my run and swim I find it difficult to open the door when I get home because my hands won't do what I want them to. And once I was stumbling back across the field after my river swim - the ice on the field kept cracking and my feet sticking through into icy water. My flip-flops kept falling off and I was stopping, turning and bending down to pick them up, all the time feeling weaker and weaker. Part of me wanted to just lie down on the ice and go to sleep but I kept going. And this was only ten minutes walk from home but there was no one around and wouldn't be for a while unless a dog-walker happened by. I was shaking violently when I got home and all thorough my cold shower afterwards. Now though I look back on that as my best morning this last winter. I'm glad I went that day too.</p>

<p>@gfx Callen suggested that those who were willing could film and post videos of them shivering.  I find it an interesting idea, but it's up to the person shivering whether or not they want to film &amp; share.</p>

<p>Hi gfx,</p>

<p>did your boyfriend ever ask you not to wear a bra or panties when you were with friends or in public? Especially when you are freezing your nipples might be producing your top then. How did you feel about it?</p>

<p>You wanted to write about your coldest moment story and how your sister got involved in your dressing style. Still interested to read about it.</p>

<p>Hi mascorta, gfx, ...
I think everyone of you could tell about situations where it became more extreme than planned. Either because something unplanned happend and there was really no way out. Some of you might found herself in a situation where there was a way out but you didn't want to admit that you came to your limits and you forced yourself to tough it out.</p>

<p>Can you remember those events?
Are you afraid that those situations might come up or do you secretely wait for it?</p>

<p>my freezing bet. </p>

<p>it was around 25 f a little breezy and cloudy.  I had to wear a tiny bikini and flip flops. and there was a foot of snow on the grass.  The first 20 minutes I had pretty big goosebumps and shivering a little bit. when it hit 20 minutes they dumped a 5 gallon bucket of water over my head I screamed in shock.  It took my breath away when I finally caught my breath my teeth were chattering so hard and the shivering was so intense.  after that I had to take my flip flops off the wet concrete was so cold on my feet.  My wet goosebumped body shaked violently for the next 20mins when they dumped another bucket of water over my head the shaking brought me 2 my knees.  They told me it was time to go in the snow I was already so cold but wanted to win.  my legs shook so hard I had to crawl in to the snow it stuck all over my wet body as much as I wanted to I didn't brush it off.  I alternated between walking and siting because the snow was almost knee high aand it hurt  my feet.  At the 1 hour mark another bucket of water.  Now I just layed in the snow shaking my skin was bright red and soaked.  the 1 hour mark also meant 2 of the 4 men lost the bet and I only had an hour to go to win ;) I rolled from front to back as much as I could but my whole body was getting numb I couldn't even stand if I wanted to.  After 20 mins laying in the snow they splashed me with another bucket I couldn't even scream my hair was starting to freeze and my skin was getting pale, after this it gets blurry as I was pretty out of it.  THey tied my hands to a tree branch at least under the tree there was no snow my feet got a break. as I stood there they threw snow balls at me for the next 20 minsthe snow was sticking to my goosebumps and the shivering shook it off.  at an hour 40 mins the last bucket of water. I began to black out here they told me I couldn't stand and my lips were blue.  At the 2 hour mark I won the bet and they carried me to a nice warm bath :)</p>

<p>This year I took my girlfriend on a two day trip to the Cologne carnival. We went in train, slept in a tent and spent most of the time in streets. I didn't allow her to take any clothes with apart from her costume - she went as Hula girl: coconut bra, short grass skirt and sandals - nothing else.</p>

<p>It was very cold and she had to dance a lot in the streets to bear it. It was a wild and fun trip ...</p>

<p>@goosebumps: I often surrender to the weather/nature. It's easier to just not take any warm clothes with me on a trip than try to not wear them. Then I have no choice but to shiver and I never know how bad it's going to be which is exciting. I'd never surrender control to other people though - I daren't even tell anyone about my love of being cold - everyone just assumes I don't feel the cold much and I certainly do all I can to keep up that pretence even when I'm freezing, unless I'm on my own when I can let go and give in to the shivers which is a lovely feeling. It must be nice to have people with whom you can enjoy being cold, but it would be nicer still to have someone with me who enjoyed being cold too.</p>

<p>@All: Does anyone enjoy being cold with others doing the same? And do you have competitions to see who can be coldest for longest?</p>

<p>Ive had a lot of competitions in the cold with a few girls</p>

<p>1 that comes to mind is 2 girls and I were brought to a frozen over lake.  We had a few rules only 2 pieces of clothing.  No socks, no winter attire, legs arms and belly had to be bare.  I wore a bikini. 1 of the other girls chose heels and a skirt and the last girl wore flip flops and shorts. </p>

<p>We got to the lake and parked at shore  and walked on to the ice it was around 15 degrees and super windy. the ice froze my feet and the wind stung. we were all shivering by the time we got to the middle of the lake. The girl in the heels fell on her butt 3 times by the time we got out there.</p>

<p>Standing out there in the open with the strong gusts of wind (the nes said wind chill was -5) we all shook uncontrollably I kept sitting down to rub my bright red feet. (I should of chose shoes lol) after 5 minutes the girl in the flipflops went running back to the car slipping on the ice a few times.
Just 2 of us left and the guys threw snow balls at us the other girl didn't last long with the wind and cold snow on her bare skin.  She took her heels off and ran back to the car.  I laid on the snow and let the guys rub me with snow before walking back :)</p>

<p>yes many more ice skating stories and I was sick for about 2 weeks with a high fever and cough but that didn't stop my freezing fun</p>

<p>Hi Goosebumps,
what was the role of your boyfriend? Did he organize these "competitions"? Was he supporting and encouraging you, maybe even asking you to go even a step forward?
Was he proud of his girlfriend?</p>

<p>Did he also ask you do to other "interesting" things for him?</p>

<p>What kind of bikini did you usually choose? Just a normal one or more on the skimpy side?</p>

<p>Can you describe youself a little bit more?</p>

<p>The worse I endured while sick</p>

<p>It was early in our relationship I wasn't used to freezing yet.  It was Christmas Eve and we planned to go to a cabin in northern woods until New Years (the cabin only had a wood stove not much heat)  I had a cough and slight fever which mad my shivering nonstop. </p>

<p>The day we left I was wearing the dress I planned for new years it was red very short thin dress that just covered my butt it was backless and cut low in front also slit on the right thigh. I also wore stiletto heels. We drove the 3 hours with out heat in the car I shook the whole way the last half of the drive my teeth chattered very bad.  when we got to the cabin the snow was so deep we couldn't get up the drive way so we walked.  that short walk in the deep snow in those heels sucked my feet were so cold and the shivering made it so hard to stand.  When we got to the cabin I shoveled off the deck while he started the fire and got the cabin ready.  After shoveling I got to sit by the stove which made me feel like I was on fire.</p>

<p>We planned to exchange gifts in the morning and I had a special treat planned for his gift.  I woke up an hour before he planned to wake.  I opened my suit case (he didn't know this but it was empty except for had cuffs. <br />
I wrote him a note saying "For your gift I will go nude this whole week and you can make me as cold as you want with no safe word. you will find me on the porch"
before this we had a safe word for me if things got too extreme I could warm up.
I walked outside still feverish and cough getting worse shocked to find out it was only 10 degrees it was gonna be a tough day.  I walked through the deep snow to the car and locked my dress and shoes in trunk they were my only clothes I was shaking so bad I had to crawl back to porch.  once on the porch I locked my leg to porch rail with the hand cuffs and waited for him to come get me luckly it was only about. 10 minutes
until he came out.</p>

<p>I was already so sick and so cold and had the whole week to go when I planned this present I wasn't sick and I wasn't expecting it to be so cold.
ill continue story soon.</p>

<p>yes I did many interesting things for my boyfriend what do you mean?</p>

<p>my bikini was always very skimpy </p>

<p>ill share some iceskating with friends stories soon</p>

<p>Surely you mean "the best you endured"? So did he just leave you locked there naked in the snow all day and all night for seven days while he watched from the window? That would be a short story but my goodness it would be exciting. He could come and "warm you up" from time to time... I'm very much looking forward to the rest of this story.

<p>Hi Goosebumps,</p>

<p>"interesting things" could be various. Maybe he asked you to wear very revealing clothes in inappropriate situations (not for the cold) or even made you being nude in public, maybe he asked you to wear high heels for a longer period, made up diet rules or asked you for other things to show his friends that you would do everything for him. </p>

<p>when he came out he warmed me up a bit and went back inside to eat his breakfast.  I layed on the snow covered deck handcuffed to the rail.  The shivering would only pause when I coughed which was getting worse.  He came out again and rubbed my goosebumped body 1 of his favorite things to do I tried to hold back the shivering and chattering teeth but couldn't. After a bit he went from rubbing me with his nice warm hands to rubbing me with snow.  I only got a break from the snow massage when we would have a smoke.  As it reached noon my skin was turning from red to blue and loosing all feeling so he released me and we went inside for lunch.  He sat me next to the stove when feeling started to come back I felt like I was on fire and my whole body hurt.  When we fini.  shed eating lunch my skin was turning back to its normal color but was still cold to the touch and covered in goosebumps my head felt so hot from the fever.  </p>

<p>After lunch we went for a walk.</p>

<p>sorry for delay there wasn't any responces thought people lost interest.  im from usa.</p>

<p>On our walk it was so cold out the snow was hardened so I walked on top sinking in once in a while up to my knees.  I tried to hide the shivers and hold back my cough but it just made me shiver more. my poor feet were bright red I wish I would of wore shoes.  I was so relived when they finally went numb. after walking for a bit he had me lay down and covered me in snow I was shivering so hard and had no clue when I would get warmth again.  after a couple minutes he lifted me out of the snow mound and layed my shaking body on a snow bank and warmed me up best he could walking back a cold front must of came through and the wind picked up it was the coldest I ever felt to that point when we got to the cabin the temp was 10 degrees and wind chill below 0 we had to sit inside awhile to make sure my cold didn't get too bad to handle after dinner we went out side and I did a few snow angels before bed.  I was still shivering in the cabin before we went out.  when I woke up the next morning my skin was still cold to the touch and outside temp was 4 degrees my cough and fever was getting worse.  I had 6 days to go it was gonna be a long week</p>

<p>As I said the next morning it was 4 degrees when I 1st went outside there was a light breeze I started shivering instantly I barely could light my smoke.  The extreme cold made the snow hard it hurt to walk on the sun was out but gave me no warmth.  After my smoke I hadcuffed my leg back to the railing waiting for him to come release me I never felt so cold before.  I just layed on the hard snow shaking covered in huge goosebumps and chattering teeth I tried rubbing my body to give a little warmth but my icy fingers didn't help 1 bit.  After about 20 minutes that felt like a enterity he came out. pleasured me in the snow to give me some warmth.  I thought he would bring me inside for a break but left me there when he got cold and went in for some warm coffee.  he watched me from the sliding door as I shook violently in the snow when he came out he brought me a glass of ice water to drink I thought my chattering teeth would shatter the glass.  I could only take 1 sip it made me feel even colder. He then poured the water on my chest I let out a scream of shock and shivered worse then he rubbed my body with the 5 cubes of icy before carrying my blue goosebumped body in for lunch.  </p>

<p>Hi Goosebumps. Of course we didn't lose interest! This is an incredible story. I'm so looking forward to hearing the rest of it. Don't make us wait too long, will you? You should try some more exploits this coming winter - make sure you haven't lost the touch.</p>

<p>Hi Joyce. It's good to hear from you again. I often think of you shivering in that cold school back here in England in the winter. I hope you're finding some respite from the heat in HK.</p>

<p>I think it's more along the lines of "nobody really has any idea what to say".  This is one continuous story spread out over multiple posts, so I think people are waiting until the end before saying much in the way of review.  Nobody's lost interest, that much can be said for sure and for certain.</p>

<p>Now, I don't mean to sound stupid, but what exactly does it look like, having blue skin?  I've never actually seen it for myself.</p>

<p>Hi Goosebumps, your skin must look amazing with its bluish tint. Its a look way to go and see it. USA and the UK are far away. Can you carry on with the stories. Your endurance is amazing. Waiting for the next instalment. Thanks for your stories so far.</p>

<p>back inside I layed on the floor shaking by the stove for over an hour before my skin was back to normal and feeling started to come back.  With my cold I was really becoming miserable but he was having so much fun so I didn't complain or ask to stop. I got up to the table to eat a quick lunch still shivering. </p>

<p>After we ate we went back outside I thought he would give me a break but I was wrong.  The wind had picked up and a snow storm was coming in.  I was still cold before going out side so I was shivering with chattering teeth instantly.  The brutal wind and blowing snow made my freezing worse he had me sit on deck and cuffed my leg back to rail. I curled up in ball trying to get any warmth I could.  So he layed me back in the fresh snow and cuffed my hand to another rail so I couldn't curl up after a couple minutes he went in and watched from the door as I shaked helpless laying on the deck in the blizzard.  After a bit he came out and brushed the snow off of my goosebumped freezing body and massaged me his warm hands felt like fire. Then he took a shovel and started throwing snow at me as I layed there.  There was nothing I could do but get covered in snow.  I tried thinking warm thoughts but the cold was to brutal.</p>

<p>im not sure the longest my skin stayed blue never really timed it.</p>

<p>I was out there over an hour that afternoon.  I started blacking out from the cold so not sure exactly how long. The blizzard was horrible.  He carried me in and layed me on the floor and massaged my body and we were intimate to warm me up.  He decided I was done for the day except for goin out for smokes.  Warming up my body was in so much pain the shivering continued for hours after inside. I hit my breaking point before we went out in the blizzard so laying in the snow was so miserable but  I pulled it off.  It seemed my misery in the cold turned him on the most so I kept strong and made it through. :)</p>

<p>It must of snowed the whole night there was a foot of new snow when we woke up.  When I woke I was the warmest I felt since the week started.  He told me we had to go for a ride somewhere today so I had to shovel a path to the car and clean of the car so we could go.  The out side temp was about 15 degrees.  The snow was so cold and deep it took me 2 hours to shovel the path to the car I had to keep sitting down to give my poor feet a break.  I was very fortunate that there was little wind today and the sun was out.  I shivered with chattering teeth as I cleaned the car off that took about another half hour before I crawled my blue body back to the cabin for lunch.  After lunch we went for a ride he said he had something special planned we drove to a nearby great lake that doesn't freeze no heat in the car of course.  I had to go swimming.  I really didn't want to swim I was so cold already.  This was the first time I complained and pleaded with him.  But he showed no mirsey and had me go in.  I had to walk through deep snow covered ice to get to the open water.  I jumped in and thought I was gonna die of shock it was so cold I lost my breath when I finally caught my breath I thought my teeth would break from the chattering.  The water was up to my waste.  He told me to go under.  I plunged in and jumped up I thought the previous day was cold but this was far worse I had to get out my shaking arms barely could pull me out.  back on sure he layed me in the snow which stuck to my soaked body my hair started to freeze.  He warmed me up a bit there ;) then had to carry me back to the cold car for the ride home.</p>

<p>Wow! Amazing! I said wild swimming was the best way to cool off. It can thoroughly chill you even on a hot summer's day. How much cooler can it make you in winter! When you come out and you're in snow. I can stand quite some time in cold unmoving air, but five minutes in freezing water is enough to make me shiver for half an hour. What must it be like to come out and then lie in the snow? And to know that you're not going to be warm again for several more days. I'm really looking forward to the rest of your story, Goosebumps.</p>

<p>You say it seemed to turn him on to see you suffering, but does that turn you on too?  It must do for you to have suggested this naked week in the cold to him. If it doesn't turn you on at the time, does the anticipation of it turn you on, or the memory of it afterwards?</p>

<p>I'm in agreement with Very Cold.  Your endurance even before you became used to freezing is quite admirable.  Another question from me: did he ever send you out on thin ice (either in shoes, skates, barefoot, etc.) knowing the ice was thin?  I'd ask to hear about it if so, but I think there are enough stories waiting to be told, so another one doesn't need to be added to the queue.</p>

<p>this week is what helped me get a higher tolerance to the cold.  I froze the whole time to the point I was completely miserable.  But kept pushing my limit to go further.</p>

<p>Ill share a freeze room story.  It was very hot out side and I went for a run.  I think it was upper 90s.  I got back completely drenched in sweat.  He brought me to the freeze room he had it set at the coldest setting im not sure the temp but it was freezing.  The big temp different made the cold feel colder.  He layed me on a bench and I was shivering instantly the bench was so cold and the cold her blowing in the room froze me.  He had a hose hooked up to the sink in the basement he used to spray me even with being in there a short time the shivering wouldn't let me scream.  He them rubbed my body with chuncks of ice he made in the freezer.  He switched off between the ice and the hose for a half hour the only thong that kept me goin was knowing it was hot outside and it wouldn't last for ever</p>

<p>@Wolfsbane: Making useful comments is important even if you don't have a story. Maybe because no one has commented on Goosebumps' latest story is why she hasn't posted more yet.</p>

<p>@Goosebumps: Did he ever lock you in the freezer room for any length of time? I'm really looking forward to the rest of your winter tale. Hope you get chance to write more soon. Stories of the cold are most welcome during our current heatwave.</p>

<p>@Very Cold: I hope obedience has nothing to do with it. What I like best is when people do it voluntarily, though forcing oneself to go beyond what you would normally with no chance of backing out is just great! But only doing it because someone else wants you to, without getting anything out of it yourself is just miserable and sad.</p>

<p>Yeah I was locked in freezer many times longest was 3hrs straight.
I have many thin ice stories.  In heels skates and barefoot.  I learned its better to be barefoot  because its easier to get out of the water once you break through.  The best part of walking on the thin ice you don't know when your gonna break through.  It always was a turn on.</p>

<p>After the swim when we finally got back to the cabin I spent time by the fire to try to warmup. I would still go outside to smoke.  I never dried off I was never so cold before this point.  He insisted that we eat dinner outside I shivered so much at the picnic table I barely could eat.  We were out there for almost an hour.  Every time he asked if I was ok I id try to say yes between shivers with a smile. After the dinner he said I could stay in till the morning I was so relieved.
By bed I was still cold I woke up many times coughing and shivering.  THe next morning I dreaded goin back out there but I did I just shock so bad.  He wanted to have a snow ball fight. My red shaking fingures barely could make snow balls.  I basically stood there shivering as he threw snowballs at me for a long time.</p>

<p>You mean not knowing when you were going to break through the ice was a turn on for you or for him? When you were locked in the freezer was he in there too? If not, could he see you through a window? Did you ever black out in the freezer? Did he ever make you spend the whole night outside the cabin?</p>

<p>The not knowing was a turn in for both.</p>

<p>1 year late fall early winter me and 3 other girls were taken to a small size lake that just froze over.  The competition was who could ice skate the longest with out breaking through.  We just had on bikinis and skates there wasn't much snow on the ice and you could see how thin it was.  When the 2nd last girl went through the game was over.  We went out after a couple minutes one of the girls went through it took her a minute to get out.  I still could barely skate so this was hard I fell a couple times and thought I was goin through then.  It was about 10 minutes till the 2nd girl went through by now we all were shivering pretty hard my skin was pretty red from falling on the ice.  Now just 2 of us left it was hard we had to avoid the 2 wholes in the ice and with all our shivering we kept falling.   It was about the 1 hour mark when I fell on the ice and broke right through after being out there for that long the crashing through the ice I almost went in shock the other skater tried to help me out and broke through to after a few minutes we made it back to shore </p>

<p>@Goosebumps: Your stories are very well-written.  Did you ever fully master ice skating, or did you always stay "not good at it"?  Were there ever times he had you in the freezer with someone else?  Lastly, did you ever opt to slip and fall on purpose while ice skating?</p>

<p>@All: Finally made a poll.  It's unrelated to the topic here, though, so feel free to ignore.  "Unusual Outfits": http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/582271</p>

<p>never mastered ice skating it hard when the only time I did it was when I was shivering.  I never had to fall on purpose I just always fell a lot.  A few time I was in freezer with another girl.</p>

<p>After the ice skating contest with the other girls.  we found another freshly frozen lake this contest we all had to walk out in heels and the girl who made it the furthest with out breaking through won.  We all were still covered in goose bumps shivering when we started.  We walked out about 15 feet and the first girl fell through she screamed loud when she splashed in the water when she got back shore she layed on the beach shaking violently.  every step we took the cracking ice got louder and louder then another girl went in.  The water was just over her head she was completely drenched.  Thinking of splashing through excited me as I shivered in the wind,  THe other girl left and I knew that the water was pretty deep where we were so we held hands and figured it be easier to get out if we had each others help we went in half way across,  the water was cold we tried to get back on ice but couldn't and basicly swam they whole way back breaking the ice as we went</p>

<p>I showed the stories here to my Man because I knew he would like them. He looked at me and said you're gonna have to do a lot to beat these girls next winter. </p>

<p>Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea. I'm pretty used to being cold as I don't have any clothes that keep warm but some stories are so extreme I don't know if I could stand it. On the other hand we both got turned on a lot!</p>

<p>Afterwards he told me I should get a used freezer big enough for training so I'm looking though some ads. </p>

<p>Ok, my Man told me to share some stories with you. I hope you don't find them too boring as I never went as far as some of the other girls. </p>

<p>This is about my New Year 2010/11! </p>

<p>The plan was to go with a group of friends to Westminster to see the fireworks and then to a club back here in Lewisham afterwards. The day before my Man told me that I would have to choose my clothes for the occasion and he had made very clear that I had to go beyond any expectations in terms of nakedness. Otherwise there would be very severe punishments.</p>

<p>I knew that I really had to outdo myself this time. I started with putting a cross of small white plasters over each nipple so that they were just covered. A normal skirt wouldn't do - that was clear so I took two small pieces (about 3''X4'') of thin white fabric and two golden chains which I used to connect both pieces. It was a little bit difficult to find the right length for the chains. No way anybody would NOT notice my lack of knickers. As I walked the two pieces would move and expose my $%!@ from both sides with each step.
Shoes were really high heeled, but with thin soles and just the bare minimum of straps to hold my feet. I completed my outfit with a pair of those bunny ears with lights. When I presented myself to my Man he was definitely pleased. </p>

<p>We were to meet our friends outside the tube station somewhat 9ish. We had to go early in order to get a good spot for viewing. I was lucky that the night wasn't extremely cold, just about 5C, so when we left home I didn't freeze at once. We had to wait a while outside the station until everyone arrived. In total we were 15, 4 other guys had brought their girlfriends along. One asian girl was wearing some shorts, two black girls a mini dress and the other white one a mini skirt. The girls with the mini skirt and the shorts were wearing light jackets and the dress of one girl had long sleeves whilst the other one was wearing stockings. I think we were all quite uncovered compared to most other girls passing by but I was definitely the one least dressed. I noticed that the other girls were looking at me with some mixed feelings: they knew that all guys were looking at me all the time so I was stealing attention from the others, on the other they were surely glad not to be almost naked like me on this winter night. </p>

<p>In terms of protection against cold there wasn't the slightest difference for me from being completely naked (except perhaps for the shoes). I was glad when everyone was there because I had started to get cold. </p>

<p>We arrived at about 10 and found a spot with a quite good view. From somewhere you could hear some music. My Man told me to get on the balustrade and dance a little bit. With the heels it was a bit difficult to get on the balustrade but my man helped me - not without lifting up the flap at my backside. It was fun to dance there in front of a big crowd, from below I'm sure everyone had a good view of my naked $%!@ and it also helped a lot against the cold.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes I was pretty exhausted and my Man allowed me to come down. In the mean time my nipples had gone so hard that they had lifted and loosened the plasters a bit yet they still stayed in place. I was greeted enthusiastically when I got back to our group. Some of the guys had brought some booze - good against the cold as we still had more than an hour till 12.</p>

<p>For the next half hour we just stood there chatting with an occasional groping here and there. I felt really cold then when the asian girl mentioned that it was a pity that she was quite short and wouldn't be able to see much. Her guy proposed that I should take her on my shoulders but my Man pointed out that I was even shorter than her and that I probably wouldn't be able to keep her up all the time. In fact it would be better if I got down on all fours and she would stand on me. They decided to try this out, the asian bitch didn't hesitate a second. I was ordered to the ground and they helped her up. She put one foot between my shoulders and the other one on my lower back. It hurt a lot, I can tell you.</p>

<p>When the fireworks finally started I didn't see anything of it. The only thing I saw were shoes and legs. By all I heard later the fireworks must have been really spectacular but I was really busy not to move at all. if the asian $%!@ would fell I'd surely be in trouble. After the fireworks ended she stayed about five minutes more on my back until someone took her off. I think that was really mean of her. I was so exhausted that I didn't want to stand up in the first place but the crowd started moving and I had to.</p>

<p>Anyway I was also freezing and the idea of leaving towards the station appealed a lot to me. The crowd was so big it took us almost an hour to get to the station's entrance. It was quite cold but in the crowd it wasn't too bad. Besides my Man had his hand on my bum almost all the time and that felt really good.</p>

<p>It was a good thing I had these bunny ears so it was easy for the others not to loose us from sight. Unfortunately I lost the group when I got on the train so I was all by myself. I got pushed into a waggon whilst the others stayed behind. I got groped a lot during the ride but I'm pretty much used to it. It definitely made the ride more interesting.</p>

<p>When I got to the destination I went outside to wait for the others to arrive. I had to wait almost 15 minutes as they had to let pass a couple of trains because they were so full. It was quite windy so I was freezing badly when the others arrived. I'm not allowed to keep my skirts down when they are blown up so my $%!@ and bum were completely exposed most of the time. I was lucky no cop came by - I might have been into trouble then. I got lots of invitations whilst standing outside the station though.The only people missing were Thomas and Amy, the guy with the asian girlfriend. They had said she needed to change before going to the club. I was happy that I didn't have to see the bitch again.</p>

<p>We still had to walk about another 10 minutes to the club. I was so glad when we arrived. There was a huge queue outside but we are habituals, it's a club where they play RnB and HipHop and basically all the men there are black, the women half/half. We go there regularly so there was a shortcut to get inside: me sucking off the bouncer. The bouncer let me in, guided me to a separate room where I did my job. Afterwards he let everybody in. In the club the air was nice and warm. My man told me to take off the plasters from my nipples, I wouldn't be needing them anymore. They were already almost falling off with the previous cold and with my nipples getting hard all the time. I took them off, crunshed them up and just threw them on the floor. They wouldn't stick anymore anyway. Before we actually entered the main room someone mentioned that Thomas and Amy were still missing. My Man considered that and told me to wait for them outside and to guide them in when they arrived so I left again. So I stood there outside with just my skirt and the bunny ears on me. The wind had ceased a bit but it was still quite cold. It took them almost an hour to arrive. I was totally frozen when I finally saw them. I was about to get them in but the bouncer insisted on another blow job. When it was over and he let the couple in the bitch said to me: Couldn't you have hurried up a bit? I was freezing to death outside! What a bitch! She had been wearing even a coat!</p>

<p>When I finally got into the main room I looked for my Man and found him chatting with some blonde girl and He had brought a drink for her and himself. He handed her the drink and started chatting with her again whilst I stood aside and didn't know what to do. I couldn't hear what they were talking about but sometimes they looked into my direction. At one moment the girl made a sign that I should come nearer. When I was directly by her side she slid one finger under one of the chains of my skirt and lifted it up to my belly which totally exposed me with my front to her and my Man and my back to the whole room. So, you were running around all night with only this on? she asked. I nodded. She turned towards my man whilst still playing with mw skirt, lifting it up as high as possible. I'd love to take this with me as a souvenir to show it to my friends she said. My Man replied: go ahead and take it. She turned to me again, opened one of the clips and put it into her purse which left me completely naked besides shoes, collar and blinking bunny ears. It wasn't the first time I was naked in this club but this time it wasn't that I had put on a show, gotten into mood and eventually undressed. This time I felt somewhat hurt and I felt much more naked than other times.</p>

<p>I think you should go ahead and do some dancing my Man said. I nodded silently and went towards the dance floor. The dj saw me coming up and shouted: we've got a New Year's bunny coming on stage! I got right in the middle and started moving. Within seconds I had a bunch of guys around me. That gave my mood a real boost. It's always great to feel desired. A couple of minutes later two guys came up to me, one positioned himself in front of me, grabbed my hips and pressed me against him, the other behind me, grabbing my waist and also pressed himself against me. It felt really good and there were lots of cheers and applause. I got really horny with this show. After two songs or so each of them grabbed one of my hands and they dragged me to gents. There were a couple of other guys, some had already been there before and had stayed to watch, others had been following us.
I stayed in for a good while. At some point I could take a break and thought I should be looking for my Man and went back to the main room just to see him leaving with the blond girl. I ran up to them and caught them just outside the club. He looked at me and said: You go home and wait for me outside until I call you in and don't you dare to put anything on. He then took a cab with the blond girl.</p>

<p>It wasn't the first time I had to walk home butt naked but this time was different because I wouldn't be able to get inside when I reached there. It had been about 5:30 when I left the club and started to walk home. It was surely a bit colder than before - just above freezing I think.At first I didn't feel the cold too badly - I just felt somewhat numb because my man had been left with another girl. i know he has every right to do so but still i didn't like it. I feared I might loose him. I was about 200 yards away from the club when I noticed that four men were following me. I started to walk faster but I felt them coming closer and when I started to run they came up fast and stopped me. I tried to escape but they hold me tightly. They asked why are you so shy? After the show in the club and now being naked on the street you surely are a complete $%!@. They dragged me into a yard between two council houses and put me down on the floor. One hold my hands and to two guys grabbed a leg each and spread them whilst the fourth used the opportunity. When he was finished another one took his place and so on until they all had their fun.</p>

<p>Afterwards they left me laying in the ground. I had some problems standing up: my backside hurt because they really hadn't been gentle. I couldn't walk very fast but I also didn't have to - the streets were empty at this time. When I reached our flat it was completely dark so my man was either away or sleeping or doing something else. I didn't know what to do so I stood in front of the door for a while but soon I started to freeze terribly. I started to do some exercises and when I got tired I $%!@ed. I always had to look out for eventual by-passers. Our street is rather quiet but there's hardly a place to hide. The only places to hide are behind parked cars. I had to hide a couple of times. On a couple of occasions someone parked a car. After they left I always went to the cars and laid myself flat on the bonnet. I needed the warmth.</p>

<p>When the sun came up, they were more and more people passing by, but as it was New Year, there weren't too many and I mostly managed to hide. Some saw me and I ran away and around the block. At some point I just couldn't run any more as my legs had gotten to stiff and I was too exhausted to keep warm with gymnastics so I had some encounters, some people offered me to take me to their homes but I declined. Some encounters ended with me kneeling or my back on the icy ground. </p>

<p>I was almost blacking out when more or less at noon my Man arrived. Alone! That was great. I tried to run towards him but I couldn't keep my balance and fell flat on the ground which did hurt but it didn't matter to me at all. He lifted me up and said, good girl - I see you've been obedient. I was happy and proud then. When we went in I was even allowed a shower before preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>And here's another one:</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago we held an auction at home with the last bidder winning 24hs with me - almost everything allowed. To make things short: in total there were 11 guys bidding and one called Steve won.</p>

<p>Before I had to leave with him, he allowed everybody to have sex with me.
I had some orgasms in the middle but at the end it had become somewhat painful but fortunately not too bad. I was completely dizzy anyway. It must have been well after 1 when it all ended.</p>

<p>I was given something to drink but not allowed to wash myself. I must have looked a complete mess with all the sperm on my body. Then Steve said it's time to go. I asked him whether I should get dressed but he said, don't bother - you're just fine like that. We left with all the guys following us outside.</p>

<p>My Man smacked me on my back and said: do everything he wants - don't bring shame on me.</p>

<p>Steve has a motorcycle but told me to walk to his place. He didn't want his bike or his clothes to get dirty. It wasn't far a away, a little bit less than a mile or so but it was quite cold and I would have to cross High Street! I started to get on my way. It wasn't the first time I had to walk the streets completely naked at night but my legs felt really shaky and I didn't have a clear head - without being drunk!</p>

<p>With all the embarrassment, being naked, having been $%!@ed and all dirty with sperm, I didn't feel much of the cold. I was alone on the street for about the first ten minutes of walking and I was regaining some consciousness which was not so great as I started to realise how cold it actually was. There was some stiff wind mixed with some drops of snow rain and I had absolutely nothing to protect myself against the weather.</p>

<p>When I approached High Street I covered my $%!@ with one hand and pressed the other one over my $%!@ and I started to run. There was a lot of light and some people standing on a bus stop and also some cars driving along. I don't know how many people have seen me as I didn't look to either side. I just ran as fast as I could in my heels across the street and again into the residential area. I was afraid that someone would follow me so I kept running until I was completely out of breath. When I just couldn't any more I was coughing hard and fell on all fours just in front of a council house. When suddenly the door opened and two guys came out I had no strength left to get up fast and keep running. In a bliss they were by my side and each of them grabbed on of my arms. Not so fast little girl they said, where do you wanna go? I pleaded them to let me go as I had to go to a friend's place. I had no remedy but to offer them blow jobs which they accepted. They dragged me into an alley just beside the council house where I got on my knees again and started servicing them. When I finished the second one the first one told me to do him again. It took really long time to finish him for the second time and so the other one also requested a second one. This also took a good while and the first one got impatient. He started to tell me hurry up $%!@, it's $%!@ing cold! I knew that already - I was really starting to freeze. When I finished they pushed me to the ground spat on me and then left me.</p>

<p>I got up and went on my way again. Nothing happened till I reached Steve's house. He was waiting at the front door and was obviously quite angry. He shouted, where have you been? I'm freezing to death out here! I tried to apologize but he wouldn't listen. Instead he pushed me into the front garden and told me to lift my arms, spread my legs and to slowly turn around. Don't stop, he said, until I tell you - no matter what!</p>

<p>He said, you're not gonna enter my house as messy as that. He grabbed the garden hose, pointed at me and turned on the water. There was no way I was going to stand this. When the water hit me I fell to the ground and curled up.</p>

<p>He turned off the water and told me: I tried it the soft way but it seems you need it the hard way. I started crying and begged him to try again that I was going to be a good girl. Again, he didn't listen. He went into the house and came back with a bag in his hands. He put the bag on the ground and took a ball gag out. You don't have to be very bright to know what you have to do in such a situation. I opened my mouth, he pushed it inside and fastened it on the back of my head. There was an old frame for beating carpets behind the garden hedges. He led me there, took some rope out of his bag and tied me to the frame - arms up and legs spread. I was crying as I was expecting to be hosed down immediately, but no: he took out a ping pong paddle out of his bag and said to me: You disappointed me. You left me waiting and you disobeyed my direct orders. I'll need to punish you!</p>

<p>He took the paddle and smacked my $%!@. He didn't hit me hard but this wasn't necessary as it hurt a lot anyway. He kept on smacking my bum and thighs and even each $%!@ twice. The last smack went on my $%!@ - that hurt really bad.</p>

<p>I screamed a lot of times and if it hadn't been for the gag I'm sure a lot of people would have turned up. I was sobbing and just hanging from my wrists when suddenly the cold water hit me. You can't imagine how cold it was. It was so cold it really hurt. The way I was tied I had no way of protecting me. The hosing seemed to go forever and when it finally stopped I was shivering really badly. Steve then untied my legs. He said, stand straight! You don't want to fall down when I untie your arms because if you fall down and get messy again we'll have to repeat the washing. I don't know how I managed to keep my balance on my high heels and my legs being all shaky when he untied my arms. It must have been the fear to go tthrough so much suffering again.</p>

<p>We went into his house where he took the gag out of my mouth. He said, stop whining or we'll do that again. As I was shivering really badly he must have felt some kind of pity because he led me to the bathroom and told me to get a hot shower.</p>

<p>You can't imagine how much I enjoyed this shower. It was like the best shower of my life! It was like coming back to life after being dead! You know, I've been out in the cold barely dressed or even cmpletely naked many times and it has been always so good to take a good hot shower afterwards but only a few times have I been freezing as much as this day.</p>

<p>My time with Steve and his friends was quite eventful (but nothing to do with cold, so I'll skip it).</p>

<p>I was really tired afterwards and just wanted to sleep. I heard Steve calling my Man telling him I'll send you your $%!@ back now, but she'll have to walk alone so it might take some time. It seemed like my man asked him how I had performed. Steve told him that I had been disobedient a couple of times but had done a good job after all. I was proud to hear that.</p>

<p>After they hung up ordered me to stand up. He tied my hands with a rope tightly behind my back and than did the same with my elbows which made my $%!@ stick out. Then he tied my ankles together but not tightly but leaving perhaps a little bit less than a foot of rope between them. Walking slowly was going to be possible like this but no chance of wlking fast or running. I thought he'd send me to the road like this but he wasn't ready yet: he put a gag in my mouth but not one like the ones I knew: this one was like a ring of plastic that kept my mouth open, not closed! Then he took a marker and wrote something on my chest. I wanted to know what he wrote but with the gag I couldn't speak but Steve led me to the bathroom where i could read it in the mirror: use my mouth - this $%!@ won't bite. Now I understood the gag. Anybody could just put his $%!@ into my mouth and I had no chance of doing anything against it!</p>

<p>This was finally the moment when I was sent outside. I think I had never felt as vulnerable as in this moment. Naked, tied up, with my mouth open and no chance of running away with heels on and my feet tied together.</p>

<p>I started walking - obviously slowly. A couple of minutes later a car came up the road. I managed to duck behind a parking car. When I tried to get up again I fell on my side into the snow. It was difficult to get up again with my hands tied. I went on walking until I reached High Street. I hid behind the corner and waited for a moment when there were only few people. I was lucky that there was nobody waiting at the bus stop. Someone must have seen me from a distance when I crossed the street but noone followed me. I was like only 200 yards away from home when suddenly two guys came out of a parking car I just had passed. I hadn't seen them. I had no chance of escaping. They grabbed my arms and looked at me and the writing on my breast. One said this is an offer too good to refuse. After they finished they pushed me on the floor, took the rope between my feet, made an additional knot leaving only about two inches of rope between them and drove away. It was so difficult to get up with my feet tied so tightly. When I finally got up I had snow over my whole body but wasn't feeling too cold because it had been so difficult to get up. I had to do mini steps now and it took me a long time till I reached our home. I was freezing when I reached the steps that lead to our door. How could I possibly get up there? The only way I could was by sitting down and moving up step by step backwards.
When I knocked at the door and my Man opened I was so happy - you can't imagine how!</p>

<p>For me this was a really wild day. Not everything had been pleasant but overall it was an incredible experience. </p>

<p>@Goosebumps: If you don't mind me asking, what was the first thing you ever did for him?  Had you experimented in the cold beforehand, or were you completely unprepared for the amount of freezing he put you through?</p>

<p>@Coalburner: Welcome back to the thread.  In regards to the freezer, it all depends on what you want done with it.  Or rather, what he wants done with it.  If you just want it for general purposes, then a smaller one will be fine.  However, if you want to do some of the ice skating stories listed without actually searching out a pond, you're probably gonna have to opt for the bigger (and more expensive) sizes.</p>

<p>In regards to the stories, I think the primary difference is that in yours, the shivering and the freezing seems to be more of an afterthought.  It's not the focus of the story, even if it's the reason the story's being told.  With some of the others, (such as the ones from Goosebumps or Shiverfan) the freezing and shivering is the main focus.  Don't get me wrong, though.  Your stories are still good.</p>

<p>@Wolfsbane706: Glad you still like me telling my experiences - even if the focus is not always on the freezing. </p>

<p>Here's another one (I already posted it under another topic some time ago - I hope you don't mind) and it's more about freezing than the previous ones, it occurred on the day of a terrible snow storm in December 2011.</p>

<p>I work as cleaner in private homes, usually right in our area but I have a client who lives like 2 miles away and I used to go there by bus.</p>

<p>It had already been windy at the morning but around noon when I finished, the storm had really started. As for clothes - I was wearing very little: platform shoes, a sheer shawl around my $%!@ and two small pieces of fabric hold together by a fixing pin on each side as skirt. Except for the shoes I could have been completely naked - it wouldn't have made a difference. When I left my client's home I started to freeze almost immediately. I'm used to a lot but this was bad.</p>

<p>When I got near the bus stop I just saw the bus leave. This line runs every 15 minutes, so I wondered what I could do meanwhile. I decided to walk two bus stops along the line, there would be one with a shelter. Whilst I was walking my skirt was constantly blowing up so I was practically completely exposed the whole time. There were very few people on the street so I believe it were mostly people in their cars who could enjoy the view.</p>

<p>In the shelter I was slightly more protected, so I could stand it somehow. When the bus arrived if was so packed it didn't even stop. The same happened with the next one. The third one finally stopped and I could get home. When I arrived my Man was first a little bit upset because I was late but when I told him what had happened he didn't even punish me.</p>

<p>At night Vinicius, one of my Man's mates, had come over for some video games and complained about the weather. My Man then mentioned that I had been outside barely dressed before and told about my previous experience. I was glowing with pride at this moment but Vi said I couldn't have done it if hadn't been for the shelter and not now when there were not a few rain drops but more wind, really heavy rain and even some snow so they came up with bet where I would have to proove that I was indeed capable of staying outside for a good while.</p>

<p>The terms were quickly fixed: first I had to choose clothes that would offer no protection. I changed my platform shoes for some completely open high heeled sandals and I chose a fishnet top and skirt. The skirt was only held together by one knot at each side.</p>

<p>I would have to walk around the block knocking at the window at each round. It's a big block so it takes a couple of minutes to do a round. If I gave up before the sixth round my Man would have to pay Vi 5 quid for each round missed. Six rounds would be a tie and every round more would mean 5 quid for my Man. Actually I was afraid of going out with this weather and having to give up early and humiliating my Man. On the other hand it felt really good that my Man had put so much trust in me.</p>

<p>When I stepped outside the wind was so strong that I was almost blown from my feet. The icy rain and snow hurt terribly but I was decided to give my best so I started my walk. The first round was terrible and I wasn't sure how to finish it. There was absolutely nobody on the street to see me. Even if my skirt hadn't been blown up constantly neither the top nor the skirt did hide anything as they were just half an inch wide holes. And if there had been people it wouldn't have mattered - I lost any sense of modesty quite some time ago. </p>

<p>During my whole walk I had to stop from time to time behind a lorry or a tree to rub my tummy, arms and legs.</p>

<p>When I reached home for the first time I felt completely frozen, my teeth were shattering and I nearly felt like giving up but I said to myself that I couldn't let my Man down and that I made one round and that I'd be able to do another and so I did. </p>

<p>The second one was physically tougher than the first but I wasn't as scared as before anymore and I didn't even consider giving up.</p>

<p>The third one wasn't actually that bad. I had become somewhat used to the cold, the wind, the rain and snow and I was starting to feel good about myself, about my endurance. At some point to cars passed along the street. The drivers must have seen me but there was no reaction. </p>

<p>The forth was even better. I was feeling really confident that I was going to win the bet for my Man and I started to think about the great sex I would be having afterwards. </p>

<p>With the fifth things started to get difficult again. I was really suffering from the cold and instead of resting every two or three minutes I had to every one or two minutes. At some point I thought about fingering my nipples and $%!@ to get some internal heat but it didn't work: my fingers were just to clumsy and cold. </p>

<p>What kept me going during the sixth round was that I knew that afterwards my Man wouldn't be losing his honour because of me but my feet had gottten really cold. The soles of my sandals were really thin and my toes started to hurt quite badly. Anyway there was no way I was going to give up before making my Man at least a bit of money although my stops had become more and more frequent.</p>

<p>When I was about to finish the seventh round I knew that the next one would be the last one but I decided to make it special. When I knocked on the window and the two guys were looking I took everything off: top, skirt and shoes and stuffed it into the letter box. I knew I was doing the right thing when I saw the guys' faces when I started round 8.</p>

<p>I had thought that there wouldn't be much difference between the little clothing before and being completely naked, yet there was: my feet were getting colder in direct contact with the ground but on the other hand it was better that my toes were actually moving now.</p>

<p>When I finally reached our home I was really finished. I just had to go inside. When they opened the door and I came in I nearly fell down shivering. I don't know how long I had been outside but it was surely almost an hour and probably more.</p>

<p>I was again allowed to have a warm shower which I really needed. What the guys needed at this point was some relief so I gave them blowjobs while still in the tub. </p>

<p>To my surprise I didn't even get a cold or anything after this day. I think the constant movement helped a lot. Maybe it's also that I have acquired good resistance against the cold </p>

<p>I am still totally proud of what I did and even thinking and writing about it makes me feel hot, wet and horny. Actually I'm quite happy that now it's summer but in a certain way I'm looking forward to the next similar experience.</p>

<p>And yes: I got our big freezer. Getting it to our home was quite something but has nothing to do with cold. I have to admit: I see the thing in our flat now and I'm kind of scared (but terribly excited too). I have no idea what kind of plans my Man has with it but it will surely include a lot of freezing.</p>

<p>Just a little update: My Man drilled a hole for breathing into the freezer, fixed a lock outside and set the temperature to -3C, "as a starter" he said. Now the thing is humming and started cooling. I wonder what will happen when it's ready. </p>

<p>I'm really scared but I can't help it, I'm getting terribly wet when I think that I'm going to be locked into this (this is going to happen for sure).</p>

<p>Please make sure this hole is big enough. These things are completely airtight you know. Make sure he doesn't obstruct the air flow by spying on you or spraying water in on you. Perhaps drill some other holes for this? We wouldn't want you to suffocate before you freeze!</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm right, what he has in mind is a gradual decrease in temperature until it's on the lowest setting.  What else does he have in mind for the freezer?</p>

<p>Thanks wildswimmer for your concern - my Man is often very harsh with me but He always made sure that nothing really bad happened to me. I trust Him completely. </p>

<p>As for what he has in mind - he only said that he wanted to train my resistance against cold in order to do such cool things like goosebumps and gfx ...</p>

<p>He is not at home at the moment but when He's back I know I will be put inside at -3C - He says we're going to lower the temperature over the next months - supposedly it goes until -18C. I don't know for how long i will have to stay inside tonight. </p>

<p>The thing is huge. I can almost stand inside. I don't know why, but the anticipation makes me feel so incredibly horny. </p>

<p>I had this idea in mind about flooding the floor of the freezer with water so you'd have a slick icy surface to practice standing on, but judging from your description, I'm not too sure that would work.</p>

<p>Wow, so many people who love the cold!  I thought I was a rarity :-)
I like being cold myself and I like to see others cold too.
I have a freezer too, but it's full of water - 0C water (I used a pond liner to stop the freezer rusting or getting damaged).  Great for cooling down in summer, and for getting even colder in winter.  I like to sit in it for an hour then enjoy shivering afterwards.
I'm in the UK (Scotland) - anyone else from around here?</p>

<p>@coalburner: I'm glad you trust him completely. I'm not surprised you feel horny with anticipation, I feel horny just thinking about you too. I hope it lives up to your expectations. You could put water in the bottom when you get in, just a few inches to keep you cool and wet. Maybe you could have a long cold shower before you start and then get in all wet. I'm looking forward to hearing more.</p>

<p>@Macaw: I'm from UK too. I felt the same too until I discovered this thread. It's nice to know I'm not the only one.</p>

<p>@gfx: Hope you're not expiring in this heat. I was in NY earlier this week. So hot...</p>

<p>@goosebumps: Where have you gone?</p>

And no I'm not, we keep a cold basement like around 60F and my bf often rubs ice all over my arms and legs :) But yea, its really hot outside which sucks because I'm not the only one wearing minimal clothes anymore.</p>

<p>@Macaw: England (Midlands): not many lakes around here but several cool rivers - one within a five minute morning run. There must be plenty of cool lakes (or lochs) in Scotland for you. I far prefer lakes to the sea but rivers are OK too.</p>

<p>i never experimented with the cold before I was with him.  He slowly introduced me to it 1st by asking if id wear a short skirt on a cold night out I still had long sleeve and a coat and boots.  I remember how cold my legs were before that I never was that cold.  After that he got me wearing heels.  What was the real shock was first time with no coat  wearing a halter dress and heels we bar hopped through town.  I shivered horrible I wasn't use to the cold and didn't like it yet on our walk home he asked me to go bare foot I took my heels off and walked in the snow the 1st time.</p>

<p>im excited to hear coalburners 1st freezer expirence</p>

<p>Hi there: </p>

<p>That's how my training started:</p>

<p>day 1 - Fri 26th July</p>

<p>Before I actually got into the freezer my Man ordered me to take my shoes off. This almost never happens. Clothed or naked - that is 
actually most of the time - I always have to wear my high heels, even when I'm sleeping. </p>

<p>I then stepped into the freezer and without my heels it's just as high as I am. As it was a hot day at first it felt good and fresh but then he shut the door and it was suddenly totally dark and the only thing I could hear was my own breath and the freezer's motor.</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time I was in a dark box so I didn't panick or anything like this but still my heart was beating like wild as I had no idea of how long I would have to stay inside. </p>

<p>At first I just stood inside, breathing in the cold air, feeling the cold from the floor slowly creeping into my feet. 
After a while my skin started to get cold and I rubbed my arms. I could feel goosebumps on them. The freezer is big but there's no space to run around or making gymnastics or so. There was not much I could do to keep me warm but to get on my knees and touching my
nipples - which were very hard at this point - and $%!@. Especially when I'm on my knees I come very easily. I just have to imagine 
to be sucking my Man.</p>

<p>This helped but a good while and several orgasms later I was quite exhausted. I had squirted once or twice on the floor and it started to freeze. Touching myself didn't help that much anymore and I started shivering. Still it wasn't too 
bad yet but my feet and knees had gotten very, very cold. I squatted on the ground and wrapped my arms around my legs and tried to avoid any contact with the walls. My teeth were shattering badly at this time. </p>

<p>From time to time I rubbed my feet and I also lost my balance a couple of times, this also because the floor had become slippery from my frozen juices and I guess also from condensed water and I started to feel dizzy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the freezer's door opened and my Man pulled me out. He then informed me that I had been in for two hours. When I was able to stand up I put on my shoes and went into the sunshine at the back yard. That was nice but I had to cut it as it was time to prepare dinner. </p>

<p>day 2 - Sat 27th July</p>

<p>Over night my Man had turned the freezer's temperature to -5C. I didn't have to work on this day and after I had taken care of all my duties at home and my Man had had his lunch, I had to get back into the freezer.</p>

<p>At first it didn't really feel colder than the day before. This time I got into the squatting position right with my arms around my legs right from the beginning and I decided not to start too early with touching myself. I waited until I was shivering a lot. This time it took me a while to reach my first o and after it I didn't start right away again and again as the day before but I took a break before starting again. I think that was a good idea, still it was very cold and I noticed the temperature difference. </p>

<p>After some time my skin felt numb and my feet hurt from the cold that was creeping in from the ground but I felt that I was still able to stay on for a bit when suddenly the door opened. Outside stood my Man with three of his mates. I looked at him and didn't notice when one of the guys suddenly threw a bucket full of water at me. I screamed when the water hit me. It was terribly cold and it even had some crushed ice in it. Instinctively I wanted to jump out of the freezer but they had already colsed the door again and kept it shut. I heard the lock clicking for the first time and I knew there was no way out. </p>

<p>I was completely wet from hair to toes. I dried as good as I could. My teeth were shattering terribly. This was tough, I can tell you. On the other hand, with the shock and everything I didn't feel my skin's numbness and the pain in my feet for a good while. </p>

<p>I don't know how long it took but when the door opened again I had a lot of ice in my hair and I think I was close to doze away. After they pulled me out I got a good spanking as punishment for trying to get out of the freezer when they had thrown the water at me. Spanking on really cold skin hurts a lot. </p>

<p>During the night I had a lot of rewarding activity though.</p>

<p>day 3 - Sun 28th July</p>

<p>Since Sunday I'm not longer allowed to open the warm water without permission. As my Man takes personal hygiene very seriously I often shower various times a day. I had already been used to using only cold or lukewarm water - but using no warm water at all is something you have to get used to. </p>

<p>Temperature stayed at -5C but as a direct consequence of my escape attempt I now get my hands cuffed behind my back before going into the box (how we call it now). </p>

<p>I had many things to do on the day so there wasn't a long single session but I stayed in four times for an hour or so. I think in terms of training this is pretty good. </p>

<p>I will keep posting my training diary from time to time if you like it and I don't bore you with it (and I find the time. today we're on day 15 and we reached -10C already.). I would just like to make a point: unlike others here I don't "like" the cold - actually I enjoy hot weather, sunshine and hot water. I just like to be able to stand it and I love it to please my Man, to make him hot for me and to satisfy him. In the end the fun is all about sex, not just about being cold.</p>

<p>Last thing - my pseudonym: I chose it when I opened the account. I had just moved out from my dumb mother's home and one of her stupid friends called me like this. Since the New Year I wrote about most people call me $%!@bunny, snowbunny or just bunny. Added by my Man: $%!@, twat and $%!@ are also good names. </p>

<p>@Wolfsbane706 - I liked your comments on my posts, so I asked my Man regarding video. He said he would possibly make some video from time to time but he didn't really feel like sharing it with "my wanker friends" ... sorry for now.</p>

<p>Coalburner: I try to be constructive/helpful when I can, since I don't have any stories to share.  Speaking of, I've noticed that you try and keep your posts as devoid of writing mistakes as you can.  However, there are spots here you pass over the mistakes for one reason or another.  If you like, I can point them out as you post, so you can spot them next time.</p>

<p>Concerning the video, that's fine.  "Feel like" implies he might change his mind later.  Also, I do enjoy reading about your training and actually have a challenge of my own to add to it.  If that's not allowed (so to speak), I'm wondering if there were any times when your Man took you ice skating, with rules.</p>

<p>@wolfsbane: You're obsessed with spelling &amp; grammar... Where's your imagination?</p>

<p>@snowbunny: I love your stories! Keep us posted. Yes, cold and sex do go together in my mind. Certainly if I want it to be good, it, and I, must be cool or cold. Not sure I like your Man's term for us though. I for one mostly do it with my partner. I love his trick with the bucket of water though - what a surprise for you! Perhaps he could slowly increase the number of buckets as time goes on...</p>

<p>I would've expected you to pick up more on the ice skating obsession rather than the spelling/grammar suggestion.</p>

<p>Being strictly honest (and serious), that particular obsession comes from long hours of beta-reading fanfiction and making sure there aren't any spelling mistakes.  My imagination, on the other hand, is usually spent updating the 5/6/7 stories I have yet to update.  Rather difficult to do with only two hours computer time each day, believe me when I say it.</p>

<p>Hi everybody! Just a little heads up for now. I didn't (and don't) have time to update my training journal. Just so much: I do continue with my training almost on a daily basis (at least 4 or 5 days a week) and it still takes me to the limit every single time. On the other hand: It's working! Now that temperatures have dropped and it's often rainy and windy being outside naked or almost so is dead easy if you can spend hours at -18C naked, often wet and the only thing to entertain yourself being an ice dildo ...</p>

<p>Will post again once I have the time. </p>

<p>Hi Snow Bunny: I'm so pleased to hear from you! I thought maybe you couldn't type for frostbite, or worse, your Man dozed off and left you locked in the freezer all night! I think you stopped this thread - everyone was waiting for your next instalment.</p>

<p>So you're down to -18C now, are you? You say "for hours": what's the longest you've stayed in at that temperature? And were you all wet when you went in, or wetted occasionally by buckets? You might be interested in this guy's techniques: http://gettingstronger.org/2012/01/the-iceman/ . You could make some money from this: Snow Bunny - The Ice Girl!</p>

<p>P.S. I like the ice dildo! :-)</p>

<p>late fall while I was still getting use to being cold my boyfriend suggested that we should go for a hike the next day for the whole day.  He said I should only wear 2 items of clothing my choice.  It was warm for that time of year so I agreed thinking it wouldn't be too bad.  I picked out my clothes the night before I thought of wearing a dress with flip flops.  But chose to wear my bikini top and short jean shorts instead and go barefoot.  I chose this because I knew he likes the goosebumps on my belly and when I go bare foot. <br />
It was still dark when I woke up the next morning when I went outside for my morning smoke.  I don't know what happened but it was so much colder then the day before below freezing!! with heavy frost on the ground I shivered right away and got excited for my day freezing even though it was gonna be hard.  I went in and put my clothes on and we drove to woods for our hike.  he never puts the heat on in the car so I was shivering the whole way there.  Every so often he would blast the air conditioning to make me shiver more.  it was so cold that day he was bundled up in boots thick pants heavy jacket gloves and a thick wool hat.  I was just in bikini and shorts. <br />
The sky was cloudy so I got no relieve from the sun and out in the woods there was a strong wind.  After we walked a short while we took a break and I sat on a cold damp log rubbing my red toes and goosebumps on my legs.  he had me lay on the ground so he could massage my goosebump covered body and hard nips. ( his favorite thing to do) then we set off again.  we came up to a river which just had a thin layer of ice on it he had me jump in the ice broke instantly and I was up to my knees in the freezing water with my arms crossed shivering uncontrollable he instructed me to lay down I shook my head no but ended up doing so I jumped out of the river screaming and shaking with chattering teeth.  he layed me on the bank and we had sex.  It warmed me up a little but I was still wet and it was going to be a long day
to be continued...</p>

<p>we continued on my feet and fingers were getting numb my hair was starting to turn to ice.  the wind was getting stronger and it started to snow just my luck.  This was early in my freezing expierences and I wasn't use to this yet I was so miserable I barley could walk and Ii tried  shook like hell we made our way to the car to have lunch I was shaking so bad I couldn't eat he sat in the car to warm up a bit while I sat on the ground that was getting covered in snow rubbing my goosebumps wih my numb fingers.  we headed back out I didn't know how much more I could take in this brutal wind with my clothes still damp.  The snow was picking up and there was about a inch on the ground luckly my feet were numb I couldn't feel it after wondering around woods for another hour or so my skin was turning blue and the shivering was so intense I could see how turned on he was.  we came to the river again as the snow turned into a blizzard he asked me if I wanted to go home. I nodded yes since with my shivering I couldn't talk.  he said then you need to go for 1 last swim.  I didn't want to but jumped in he had me in there for 5 mins and had to help me out now I couldn't stand my lips were blue.  this is the last I remember until I woke up under covers in bed my skin still cold to touch.  I blacked out after my swim and he carried me to the car had heat cranked allthe way home gave me a warm bath and put me to bed.  I was so sick the next week.  As miserable that I was I was proud I could do this and he really loved it I tried to push it further and further every time.  while I was freezing he made me feel I was the most sexy woman in the world. It made it all worth it.</p>

<p>What's the point of seeing a man freezing? Small balls? Anyway - usually men suffer less from the cold but we are less likely to get bodily harmed by hypothermia. </p>

<p>Same point as a woman surely?  We all enjoy seeing the opposite sex shivering and struggling with the cold?  Hypothermia is overrated, people get all upset when they get cold, it's just uncomfortable, and something that can be enjoyed.</p>

<p>@coalburner: That's some really intense training :)</p>

<p>@wildswimmer: yes, its usually 50-70F now, still pretty warm for me.</p>

<p>@goosebumps: haha, my bf would do the same thing to me. He would make me wear a tank top and miniskirt while he dresses up like an Eskimo on random winter mornings. He would drive me in his car with AC on instead of heat and then take me on a walk in a park outside the city while the snow covers up my freezing blueish skin. We would talk at first until my chattering teeth completely takes over my talking and we would continue walking for hours. He would stop and carry me back to the car when he realizes I'm completely numb. Then he puts me in the back of the car where I continue to shake and shiver and then I fall asleep. When I wake up in my cold bedroom, my skin still feels ice cold. We do this like a few times each month during the winter when we have time. </p>

<p>@macaw: I don't think she should ask her bf to be cold too. During the winter, I'm always wearing tank tops and mini skirts while my bf is all covered up in a huge jacket, thick pants, and gloves and I like it that way. Part of the reason we freeze ourselves is to look sexy but I don't think guys look sexy in minimal clothes, they look sexier in business clothes LOL </p>

<p>To Macaw: No, I don't like to see men shivering. That really doesn't go with my vision of masculinity. Sure, a man in just a shirt on a cold winter day who just doesn't care can be somewaht interesting but I don't have a cold fetish anyway. I just like to show off my bare skin - and the I just don't bother with the weather: short skirts, bare arms, legs and belly it is - rain, wind, snow (well, we don't get much of snow around here - if it's cold, it's dry) - whatever. </p>

<p>What I like about winter is the opportunity to be (nearly) the only woman with little clothes on ... this winter was really long and cold so there were plenty of opportunities to shock people and to play the tough one. </p>

<p>Surely a man shivering but putting up with it is masculine?  I would have thought he would feel a bit inadequate with his gf stripped off but he wants to wear all those clothes.  I'd certainly think a guy was a wimp if he was dressed warmer than his girl.</p>

<p>@goosebumps: Wow, that's an exciting hike reminding me of some of my "adventures" ;-) Did you also wear such little clothing during the week you were sick? I always enjoyed the extra kick my bf (and I, haha) used to get from me being outside on a winter day shivering in, like, a crop top and hot pants despite being sick, and hence freezing even more ;-)</p>

<p>@gfx: I pulled off a very similar stunt as a surprise for my bf's birthday in February. The difference was that I drove the car with AC on and picked him up for a football match he so much wanted to attend, but it was sold out - however I had been able to get two tickets from a friend who works for a newspaper. He was very pleased when he opened the door and saw my outfit -  even more so when I showed him the tickets: I had told him on the phone that we would go to a restaurant, but as soon as he realized that we would attend an outdoor event his eyes widened. It gradually occurred to him that I would be outside for several hours in subzero temperatures and wind wearing just a crop top and miniskirt, and his surprised gaze turned into a mischievous smile, the same smile that always made a warm wave rush through my already shivering body ;-) I was quite excited among the heavily dressed crowd on the stands and my summery outfit of course got me some attention, thus I didn't feel the cold at first although I had been shivering even more since I left the car. Towards the end of the game a drizzle started, the temperature had dropped by another few degrees, and for almost three hours I had been mostly standing, although jumping and cheering at times, in the cold damp wind. I didn't fall asleep, but I was quite exhausted, and the tickle in my throat I had felt in the morning had developed into a slight cough, which I was not sure how long I could still manage to stifle - on the other hand, my bf really liked (and it turns me on) when I would try not to cough, and finally fail, haha! I was shivering in waves, had huge goosebumps on my bluish skin, and my teeth were chattering that I could hardly talk, only interrupted by an occasional sexy (stifled) cough ;-). I could barely walk in a straight line although I hadn't drunk. On our way back to the car my bf put his arm around my waist to support me. We didn't turn on the heat so back at home I was even colder, but at the same time I felt hot inside to such an extent that we had to seek some, uh, cooling in the frosted garden ;-) </p>

<p>I can only imagine what you two are doing when you wake up (and during breaks in your sleep as well, haha)</p>

<p>@lissy w: Good to see you back! I agree with you, I always wear little clothing even when I'm sick. I went outside for a walk with my bf once when I was sick in subzero weather and it was soooo much colder and my skin was filled with goosebumps the second I stepped outside but I love the feeling of it and my bf loves seeing me shiver so much :) Also, I love how awesome I look wearing nothing but a tank top and short shorts in the winter when I am clearly sick! The only downside to this is that I get more and more sick and I would never go to the doctor because he keeps telling me to put more clothes on and to eat more which I am obviously not willing to do because I want to show off my thin body. So it takes me a long time to get back to full health since even at home, I would still be wearing minimal clothes and shivering in my bed since my bf doesn't put on the heat to make sure my skin is always freezing cold. </p>

<p>Also, I really admire your stunt! How were you able to drive safely while shivering so much? I tried it once and my leg couldn't hold firmly on the brake because it keeps shivering lol</p>

<p>@gfx: Thanks for your warm (or should I better say cold :-D) words! Well, I tried to drive on our way back, but I was shivering too much and had to stop after a mile and switch places with my bf lol</p>

<p>You are right, it is the contrast between subzero weather on the one hand and still wearing very little despite being freezing cold, shivering, and clearly sick on the other that looks and feels awesome! Do you have to cough or sneeze a lot when you are sick, and try to stifle them? I think that is quite sexy as it underlines how sick you are, but play it down and still go out and look stunning in that little nothing, covered in goosebumps all over while trying to hold back the fever-intensified shivering :)
Same here with the doctor, dressed in just a crop top and shorts, a thin body simply looks much better, and I will not put on more clothes or weight either, rather loose some more ;-). I wouldn't consider it exactly a downside though: If you get more sick and take longer to recover (if at all until spring ;-)), you (and your bf, haha) have more fun, and have it for longer - I would call that a win-win situation :)</p>

<p>@barefoot_anja: At first I wore some navy blue strappy stilettos since I wanted to add a touch of glamour to my outfit - it was my bf's birthday after all. However, during the long match my feet started to hurt despite being increasingly numb from the cold. I had no choice but to take off my shoes and go barefoot for the rest of the night - which drew most of the remaining warmth from my feet, but at least they no longer hurt ;-)</p>

<p>Hello all again! </p>

<p>I am glad to see this thread has returned!! I was afraid that this was starting to die! I am glad to see that I am not the only one that has this, well I guess you can say "interest." I have always been seriously turned on by cold girls specifically goosebumps. I love chattering teeth, shivering, the stuttering that comes with etc. but to me nothing is better than feeling a girl's arms with goosebumps so intense and cold it almost hurts after a while to rub! </p>

<p>It's still pretty warm here in eastern USA, temperatures in the 80s so not a lot of extreme cold situations yet. However with the air conditioning so high in some of the buildings and the girls wearing so little that can come in handy in some situations! ;)</p>

<p>I am taking an advanced writing and philosophy course this semester as part of the $%!@ Laude program and I went to the first day of class about 6 weeks ago or so. I sat down and the room was approximately 66 degrees, so a chilly room for most, perfectly comfortable for me. I put my books down on my desk and lo and behold, an extremely attractive girl walked in the room and sat down in front of me. </p>

<p>She was blonde, very tall and slim but still quite well built. She was I'd say about 5-11 and had long arms and legs. Her shorts were clearly too short for her because I could see her lime green thong sticking out, and her black bra strap out of the side of her white tank top. She sat down started rubbing her arms and legs. I saw huge goosebumps all over ever single inch of her body, her arms, back, legs, and somewhat exposed chest area which were all mostly bare. She also had probably the hairiest arms I have ever seen in a girl which is always a massive extra turn on for me as well. </p>

<p>I could hear her teeth chattering as she tried to warm herself as best as possible. She spent most of the class period rubbing her arms and trying to not make her chattering teeth a loud distraction. Her arms especially were coated with goosebumps to the point where I thought it almost looked as if the inevitable prickling sensation must have been painful until she would shudder and they would get even bigger and more intense. Her arm hair must have been sticking out a full inch or more especially on her forearms. When it came time to introduce ourselves to people sitting near us she turned to me and we started a conversation. I noticed she just crossed her arms in front of her and tried not to shiver her goosebumps clearly giving away how cold she was until she eventually gave up and through extreme chattering teeth told me that she was sick, and was having hot and cold flashes. She said she woke up that morning extremely hot and since it was late August and about 95 degrees decided to wear as little as possible. </p>

<p>Well she continued saying that she realized as she got halfway to class she would probably start getting chills, and didn't bring a sweater or jacket. In the heat she said that she started to feel actually cold in the 95 degree heat, to the point where she had goosebumps. When she walked into the ice cold building she basically couldn't get anywhere close to warm and was trying to not shiver loudly to distract others. Since we just met I didn't try anything obviously. But when she showed me her right arm I couldn't resist but touch it, and I have never felt anything like that ever. </p>

<p>Not a bad way to start out the year! Unfortunately that is the only cold story I really have so far! People just don't get cold here yet like you'd expect!</p>

<p>I'm with Txbossman on the video ideas too! Videos showing chattering teeth, goosebumps, shivering etc. anything! I am not even sure where to start because youtube I think I've pretty much exhausted trying to find anything.</p>

<p>There are a few, I am wondering if there are video search engines where you can find public videos with people specifically girls shivering and cold. I've tried goosebumps, goose bumps, cold shivering, freezing, chattering teeth, and chills. The problem is that on youtube if you type in "goosebumps" the book/tv show shows up, and "shivering" you get things like shivering isles or shivering timbers. So youtube really doesn't work very well. There was a guy who posted a playlist of like 40 great shivering videos and updated it regularly but was recently taken down unfortunately.</p>

<p>What other searching ideas do you guys have? </p>

<p>I suppose getting sick can be a good thing lol, only thing is, my boss doesn't like me coughing and sneezing in the office all the time so he tells me to go see the doctor who just keeps telling me to wear more clothes :( </p>

<p>@daewongkim: Yes, you should definitely pursue her. See if you can persuade her to continue dressed like that as long as possible into the winter.</p>

<p>@shiverfan: Good to see you back! Did you ever finish telling us about Elizabeth? I think you should meet goosebumps - she sounds so much like your Elizabeth.</p>

<p>@coalburner: How's your training going? Do be careful of frostbite - please.</p>

<p>I find this time of the year, when the temperatures are falling (at least in the northern hemisphere), very interesting. It is fairly obvious that different people have different comfortable temperatures, ranging from 27C (80F) for people from hotter climes to around 12C (54F), below which they will cover up their arms, legs or both. On colder mornings I see people dressed so differently, and I wonder which of those still with bare limbs will continue to bare their arms or legs well into the winter. Probably very few. If you see the same people each day you can see when they finally cover up. Only rarely have I seen a girl in a strappy top at 2C, a guy cycling in a T-shirt at 3C. Maybe some of them are just optimistic that it will still warm up later. How many times have you heard that phrase, I've brought it along "just in case it gets cold"? I have always taken the opposite view and gone without in the past unless it was really cold and horrible weather. This winter though I have no choice since I got rid of all my long-sleeved clothes last Spring. I rarely become ill though and I put that down to my not wrapping up warm giving all those germs somewhere warm to breed. I'm surprised you others get ill so often. I really don't see what's so sexy about a red streaming nose and a hacking cough.</p>

<p>The best and longest video I saw was one that Joyce posted a link for long ago: http://xhamster.com/movies/404854/trial_by_snow.html . The girl appears to be really enjoying it, though gets she fed up by the end and you can skip the last minute or so because when she's telling us she likes being cold, now all wrapped up in a coat, you can tell that she doesn't mean it. In fact the whole latter half is best watched with the sound muted. I love the way her skin slowly turns blue all over.</p>

<p>I never consider my clothes based on temperature when I go out.  I consider them on the least I can get away with without looking too weird.  I've been chucked out of two supermarkets for shopping shirtless.  They quoted some stupid "hygiene" rule.  I pointed out to the manager that he had bare arms, and I wasn't about to roll around in his tomatoes, so what was I doing that he wasn't, but he wouldn't listen.  I simply shopped elsewhere.</p>

<p>@wildswimmer: Yea I find this time of the year interesting as well. Also, where I live, I noticed that most of the Asians girls are covering up on the top but still have bare legs while most of the White girls are covering up their legs but still have bare arms. And I agree, very few continue to bare legs and arms during the winter but like what you did, I donated all my long-sleeved clothes and pants and tights and whatever else keeps me warm so all I have now is tank tops, short shorts and miniskirts. </p>

<p>I don't get sick that often either but when I do, I don't recover for a long time, probably because I continue to dress minimally and shiver more and more. Sometimes, I would stay at home for a day or two to recover but usually, I can't resist the fun of going outside and shivering so much more. Also, its not the sneezing and coughing that's sexy, its the fact that I'm still wearing a tank top and miniskirt in freezing temperature when I'm clearly sick that's sexy.</p>

<p>It's great to back! I'm glad you enjoyed my story! :) I do a lot of writing for various things here at university so it's nice to be able to take my experiences and use them as "inspiration" for creative writing here!</p>

<p>Gfx: If only there were more girls here like you! I am still with my girlfriend which is the primary reason I probably won't say anything to this girl in my class out of respect for her. She still is trying to brave the cold more for me but she struggles because she is naturally cold enough as it is. Maybe in a few years she'll be half as brave as you guys! ;) </p>

<p>I agree that the whole sick thing is kind of sexy because people tend to get chills when their sick so they will shiver more and their teeth will chatter louder because they're very chilled. A close friend of mine was so sick with a 105 fever. I went to her house to check up on her and she came to the door in a short sleeved shirt, shorts, wrapped in a blanket.</p>

<p>She was shaking visibly as she opened the door, and we talked in her living room. Her teeth were chattering uncontrollably. She took off her blanked and showed me her arms, her long blonde hair were sticking up everywhere as they were covered in some of the biggest goosebumps I have ever felt. She's normally a cold person but she always covers up which is kind of a let down. But because of her fever she has such severe temperature fluctuations, so she was dressed light with a heavy blanket. When she got in her chilled periods, she would wrap the blanked as tight around her as possible, and her teeth would not stop chattering. The goosebumps would remain too and were basically constant so even when she would take her blanket off they were still there.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting the video link but I was also thinking more focused on shivering, goosebumps chattering teeth etc.</p>

<p>@gfx and wildswimmer: I could not have put it better than gfx - it is largely the contrast of daring to wear flimsy clothes outside in the cold despite being clearly sick and freezing that is sexy ;-) Especially when you try to deny and hide it, but finally fail since the telltale coughing and sneezing can no longer be stifled as it gets worse, just as the fever chills become more and more intense * g*.
Certainly I get sick - almost everyone does, including my friends who bundle up heavily. I guess how long it takes to fight off the germs, or even hinder them entering your system in the first place, depends more on the adaptation capability of an individual's immune system to new virus mutations than on being cold or warm. However, I agree that you can train your immune system to acclimatize by maintaining a summery style of clothing while it gets colder. I do not think that I get sick much more often than anybody else after all.</p>

<p>@gfx: I continue to go to work when I am sick as well, otherwise I would not be able to go out after work and have fun ;-) I only stay at home when I am really, really sick lol I guess your boss is just concerned that you could spread the bug around the office - that is another reason why I try to hide and stifle my coughs and sneezes as much as possible ;-) Then again, I work as a field representative, so I am out of office much of the time anyway lol</p>

<p>Hi Daewong Kim,
I understand, how's your gf doing? Is she braving the cold too? You should still try to encourage her :) I am naturally cold too since I am very thin and have very little body hair. Before I started dressing minimally, I used to shiver and get goosebumps when I'm wearing a tank top and shorts at 70F but now, when its 70F, I don't feel cold at all and maybe even feel warm. Once she gets used to it, it will be a lot better. Also, I like your sick story. My bf loves touching my skin when I am sick.</p>

<p>Hi lissy,</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me clarify it lissy. For those of you that never tried it, wearing flimsy clothes when you are sick is A LOT colder. And I agree, everyone has the same chance of getting sick no matter what you wear. </p>

<p>I also continue to go to work and a lot of the girls at my company admire me for being able to wear such a little amount of clothing despite being so sick and still doing my job. And yea, my boss is concerned that I make other people sick but he thinks I look sexy too so he just tells me to go to the doctor and get some meds which I never do because my doctor would always scream at me and tell me that I need to wear more clothes. </p>

<p>I got her out 4 more times the past 2 weeks.  3 times in very short shorts once in very short mini skirt.  Temps every time around 37 degrees.  Great Goosebumps on her legs.  She doesn't enjoy the cold or the Goosebumps but she is trying</p>

<p>hey shiverfan, your gf reminds me of when I started wearing minimal clothes. I started with bare legs first and my bf would have me go out in a miniskirt 3 days a week and I didn't enjoy the shivering or goosebumps at first either. Once she gets a bit more used to it, it will be a lot more fun for her :)</p>

<p>I remember back in December of 2005, I ran a 5K race at Centennial Park in Nashville.  It was (I think) 17 degrees that morning.  Despite the cold, there were some cheerleaders there (in uniform!) filming some type of video.  Between takes, they had to wrap their bare legs in blankets to stay warm!  I thought that it was so sexy of them to be out there in such cold weather wearing their sexy short cheerleader miniskirts!  I talked with them, and found out that they were from Mt. Juliet Christian School.  I complimented them for being willing to go bare-legged on such a cold day.  Because it has been so long since that day, none of them are still there.  But since they were willing to bare their legs out there on such a cold day, I believe that they deserve some credit for that!</p>

I agree about that movie. Indeed I like the fact that she did not like it any more. She should have been send back naked in the snow for some time. She turned blue but did not shiver.
I like my husband to this kind of thing and naked men in the snow is a pretty sight for me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am new here and first I like to thank you all for your amazing stories and willingness to share your thoughts and desires! </p>

<p>I would like to add few ideas for finding good photos of women with goosebumps on their skin. I have searched all over internet for ladies wearing short sleeved summer dresses in slightly too cold conditions so that skin is covered in big goosebumps but still maintains fresh skin tones. It seems that very few of us share that particular desire, but if we are lucky we can find almost what we are looking for on photo sessions with a different purpose, for example “soft core fine photography”. </p>

<p>It is too bad that most of these sites are so focused on naked models, because I personally find ladies so much more attractive when wearing classy mini dresses, but with goosey skin of course!</p>

<p>Anyway, what we can hope for is photo sessions on a cold day and that the session includes few shots before the model dresses off! It is rare, and the photos also have to be high resolution and with correct focus etc. Sometimes we have to accept models being naked if the goosebumps are good. </p>

<p>Here are few examples: </p>

<p>http://jamesskaar.hopto.org:8080/images/nude/domai/g/gabriell/2011-08-30%20-%20gabriell-2-2000/gabriell-2-8171.jpg</p>

<p>http://imgchili.com/show/24443/24443304_flori_2_00454.jpg</p>

<p>One way to find similar photos for free, is to scan this forum:</p>

<p>http://kitty-kats.net/forumdisplay.php?15-Picture-%28Thumbs%29-Posts</p>

<p>99.9% of the series are crap, and be sure that your antivirus protection is up to date!</p>

<p>Hey everyone! Sorry it's been a while since I have posted! :)</p>

<p>Thank you goosebumpsforever for posting these links! How did you manage to find some of these? I also agree with you that I prefer them to be wearing clothing, but minimal clothing. I love tank tops especially! </p>

<p>Do you know of any videos that show shivering, goosebumps etc.?</p>

<p>How is everyone doing with the cold this time of year? Where I am it isn't terrible it's about 40 degrees but people cover up more than I would have expected already so I haven't been able to see much goosebumpy action, but I will keep my eye out! :)</p>

<p>oh I should also add something else too. I don't particularly like nudity or erotic photos of women in the cold as much as I like it just happening naturally. Like if I'm out with a female friend and she forgets to bring a sweatshirt and it's cold in the restaurant or wherever we happen to be, and she has goosebumps wearing a tank top or something, that to me is much sexier. </p>

<p>I realized that goosebumps are to me the ultimate appeal. Chattering teeth and shivering are nice, but they imply goosebumps. I found that on "keek" which is another video share website everyday people especially teenage girls (around my age so it's alright ;) will post videos of them cold more than looking on youtube.</p>

<p>Youtube I have actually had almost no luck finding videos of shivering/goosebumps. I've tried vimeo as well and have found nothing. </p>

<p>Something about the sight and feeling of goosebumps is just incredible, especially if there is a lot of hair or they are exceptionally intense. Also goosebumps on the arm are my favorite place. Something about seeing every single hair sticking out from the shoulder all the way down to the wrist and bumps on every single millimeter of skin is just incredible and then running your hand over it and feeling each individual bump. I love it when you can feel the hairs themselves over the bumpy skin too. I find that the best place for huge goosebumps is the back of the upper arm. Some people get them really big on forearms too. I think this is why to me tank tops, halter tops, sleeveless dresses are incredibly sexy showing bare arms even above bare legs.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>@daewongkim1994 </p>

<p>Nice you like the pics! I have found them by scanning the kitty-kats forum.  Â¨</p>

<p>It's a pity that there are no photo studios producing high quality pics from scenarios like you describe; thin dressed ladies in natural, everyday situations that are unexpectedly chilly – with subsequent reactions on the body!</p>

<p>Goosebumps are my ultimate appeal too and I prefer them on the upper arm! The perfect garment is a summer dress with very short sleeves and short skirt, but for some reason tiny sleeves are more attractive than sleeveless <br />
You never know what games the mind is playing!    </p>

<p>One of the best videos I have found of a photo session with a freezing model covered in goosebump is “Palmas the movie” from MetArt studio with model Iveta. It can be downloaded for free here: </p>

<p>http://uploaded.net/file/bkd08gbm/MetArt_Palmas-The-Movie_Iveta-B.avi</p>

<p>The resolution in HD video is not enough to see the goosebumps very well, so I prefer photos: </p>

<p>@Wolsbane706 I am doing wonderfully! I am not seeing a whole lot of goosebumps/shiver action yet but hopefully that changes soon!</p>

<p>I would like to share another story if that's alright!</p>

<p>So this happened a few weeks ago with one of my close friends.</p>

<p>We were hanging out one evening, and she asked me if I would like to come over to her apartment and I agreed. I arrived and we had a nice evening together doing various things. She is a shorter, stouter girl but has very pretty face, and a very nice body. She isn't terribly susceptible to cold unlike most of my female friends so I usually don't think of her as a big target for cold action. But this night was quite different!</p>

<p>She was wearing a tight short sleeved t-shirt and shorts despite it being about 40 outside. She wasn't planning on going out so she just dressed like she would for a day inside. We were watching a movie and I noticed about halfway through her arms were crossed tightly and she was shaking. She had enormous goosebumps all over her arms and legs. "I'm freezing" she said and went to get a blanket. She came back and a few minutes later started shivering again, with even bigger goosebumps and her teeth were chattering so when she said how cold she was she couldn't even talk normally. So she had to get up, put pants on, grab her winter coat and a think blanket on top of that and her teeth were still chattering. About an hour later she warmed up and actually got hot like she usually is and stripped down to just a tank top and shorts again. But about a half hour later probably the worst shivering episode I have ever seen erupted as she physically couldn't be still from shaking, she had goosebumps like I have never seen and her teeth couldn't stop chattering to save her life. She had to grab a long sleeved shirt, a sweatshirt, a winter coat, and three blankets and still was shivering.</p>

<p>When I left that evening she walked me to the door, hugged me and kissed me on the cheek as she usually did. Even though she was covered in goosebumps and shivering her skin felt warm, so I assumed she was having a fever. When I talked to her the next day she said she had a 104 fever and goosebumps never left her skin all day long. She had the early stages of the flu. Well she eventually recovered and we're still good friends now, and she has gone back to her always hot self!</p>

<p>So that was my most recent story, I'm just curious does anyone else also find that even though it is in a way rather sadistic, when someone is sick especially with a fever and feels so much colder that is sexy?</p>

<p>I agree, it is sexier when they're sick and more susceptible to shivers.  I personally think ice skating is one of the best ways to trigger a girl's shivering.  I've also been meaning to ask if you personally have any ice skating stories to share?</p>

<p>@wolfsbane706: I unfortunately do not have a lot of ice skating stories really. I do enjoy ice skating and have done it a lot, but most of the girls I go skating with prefer to cover up quite a bit and we usually skate vigorously for conditioning purposes so we heat up pretty fast haha. Maybe this winter though I will keep that in mind! :)</p>

<p>@lissy w. Great to hear from you again! There is something about a girl being sick with chills that is undeniably sexy. Can I ask you what you go through when you are sick? Like do you get biggest goosebumps, do you get goosebumps more easily? Does your teeth chatter harder etc?</p>

<p>My girlfriend is extremely susceptible to cold because she is so thin and is a naturally cold person. She is a gorgeous young lady, about 5'10' and thin as can be, yet has some nice curve to her. She has a lovely amount of arm hair especially on her forearms and gets goosebumps quite easily. When she gets goosebumps they are so intense that she says they start to hurt after a while, and i can see why. Her goosebumps are enormous, and the hair sticks up well over an inch and they completely cover her entire body. Also her teeth chatter so much.</p>

<p>We will be just sitting inside a maybe 68 degree basement and if she is wearing anything that bares her arms she'll shudder, cover in goosebumps, and her teeth will be chattering for nearly the entire time sometimes. </p>

<p>She does know that cold turns me on and tries to accommodate but sometimes it is just too much for her. One time she had the chills really badly and the poor thing couldn't keep her body still and her teeth silent with two jackets on and a blanket. But she still tried to strip down to just a tank top. When she did I have never experience someone shivering like that in my entire life, nor felt goosebumps that intense. </p>

<p>Sometimes, I consider a story more interesting if the shivering is the result of an activity rather than just going out.  I think (and hope) that I'll have some stories of my own to share after I move.</p>

<p>Also, is anyone having issues with notifications?  Haven't gotten one since October, myself, and I'm wondering if anyone's in the same boat.</p>

<p>Friday night and Saturday afternoon were very cold here in Montreal (-21C/-5F and -27C/-17F with wind chill). I spent several hours outside with bare legs, the wind was freezing especially in the old port, but I love the feeling and I didn't suffer from the cold (except that my knees were red). 
Sometimes even in such low temperatures I meet other bare-legged people in the streets, however this time I didn't see anyone with uncovered legs.</p>

<p>Dear all, especially our attractive ladies,</p>

<p>in a similar board (now closed) a young lady who was very proud of her slim figure and especially her flat stomach and therefore was wearing only a minimum of clothes also in winter reported about her Christmas experience. Her husband / boyfried (don't remember) had organized to stay at friends house for the christmas holidays. The fact that she was asked only to wear a minimum of clothing these days was of course what she aspected. So she tried her best to look good the days and adjusted her diet accordingly the days before their visit. What she didn't aspect was, that her husband told the hosts that they didn't have to bother for his wife when setting the table. She would be on a no-calorie diet during their stay. So she had to take part on every festive meal without eating a single bit additional to the more or less continous freezing.</p>

<p>What are your plans to keep your figure over the festive seasons? What are you planning go wear for Christmas and New Year? Do you have any self imposed or set up rules?</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas to all of you!</p>

<p>@daewongkim: I think it is very cute of your girlfriend to strip down to just a tank top (what, if anything, did she wear on her legs btw?) despite being sick with a fever, while she was already freezing and shaking in multiple jackets and blankets. What was her temperature, and did she show any other cold symptoms? How long did she last in her tank top, shivering cold and sick, e.g., did you take her out? Did she get even sicker from freezing?
Indeed I get goosebumps much easier and sooner when I am sick, and I find it difficult to keep my shivers and teeth chattering under control when I am already busy holding back, or at least stifling my coughs or sneezes ;) However, I feel somehow sexier when I am obviously sick but still going out, I am kind of proud to show off my huge goosebumps and slim shivering body still wearing as little as ever, along with a sniffly nose, held back sneezes, and stifled coughing ;) Some guys even think that my shyness about being sick is sexy :)</p>

<p>@ DaewongKim: 
Nice stories :) I love how your friend decided to brave the cold even though she was sick. Whenever I am sick and I am wearing minimal clothes, I always feel extra cold and shiver very intensely but at the same time, I feel extra sexy and my bf gets turned on even more haha I don't think its sadistic at all, but then again it might just be what I think since I always wear minimal clothes no matter what. Anyways, I'm glad you were able to see your friend shiver and that she got better fro her flu.</p>

<p>As for your gf, she sounds pretty sexy :) Also, it seems like she has a lot of arm hair which is rare for girls. And yes, goosebumps can hurt especially if they are really intense. After a while in the cold though, your skin will start to feel numb more than hurt. You should encourage your gf to brave the cold more; I am a naturally cold person as well but after some practice/experience, my tolerance rose. </p>

<p>@ ferfred:
That story is pretty interesting and very relatable to me. I also wear minimal clothes because I am proud of my slim figure (flat stomach, thin legs, etc.) I have been wearing tank tops and short shorts every day so far during my Christmas break and I am literally freezing every day. In fact, on Christmas night, my bf decided to take me on a romantic walk in Central Park. It was 15F/-10C degrees and super windy that day and I knew I had to take a long walk out in the cold so I tried to find something that was a bit warmer than my usual tank top and short shorts but my bf made sure my wardrobe didn't have anything remotely warm. I ended up wearing only a tank top and a 10 inch mini skirt and my bf allowed me to wear a scarf. My entire body was filled with goosebumps and shaking uncontrollably a few minutes after we went outside. Luckily, the subway warmed me up a bit (and I received a lot of shocking looks from every in the subway haha) but once we got out and walked outside I was shivering uncontrollably once again. After about half an hour, my skin was ice cold to the touch and felt kinda numb so my bf suggested we sit down to warm me up. He took off his gloves and had some fun feeling my ice cold thin legs which got him super turned on. After talking for a while on the bench with my chattering teeth that made what I said hard to understand, my bf said he had no idea what I was saying and we started heading out. On my way out though, I was so freezing cold I couldn't walk anymore so my bf gave me his jacket to warm up my body so we could make it home. It was one of my coldest experiences ever and we both really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Also, I go on diets too during the holidays although my bf has never asked me to go on a no-calorie diet since I have super fast metabolism and I'm naturally slim. I usually just go on a vegetarian diet if I see that I am about to gain weight. My only rule is to keep myself under 110 lbs which is pretty thin for 5'10 (and of course, to wear minimal clothes!).</p>

<p>@lissyw: Good to see you around again :)</p>

<p>Also, Merry Christmas everyone!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas everyone first of all and I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday! :)</p>

<p>@lissyw: Thank you for your comments! She was wearing a tank top but had on long pants as she usually wears blue jeans. The tank top lasted about 15 minutes until her shaking and chattering teeth were so intense she just couldn't bear it any longer. We didn't go out because she is very shy about that and likes to keep it just the two of us, and when she is sick she prefers to stay at home. She gets goosebumps so easily though and her teeth chatter almost at a slight shiver. Anytime she has bare arms in a room less than 70 degrees she's usually covered in goosebumps and her teeth will chatter if she gets the shivers too. What are your goosebumps like? How often do you get them?</p>

<p>@gfx: Thank you for your comments as well! :) She has a good amount of arm hair which is a massive turn on for me, especially on her forearms. But nothing too terribly extreme. But when she gets super cold, it actually looks painful. Her skin doesn't even feel like skin anymore it's so rough from the extremely intense goosebumps and the chilled feeling. Her arm hairs stick out so much and look like they're about to rip out of her skin. How do yours feel usually now? I absolutely love the feeling of goosebumps of any kind but my two favorite kinds are the ones where the skin is smooth usually so it's just a bumpy texture, and the ones where there is a lot of hair so you can feel the individual hairs sticking out of the individual bumps.</p>

<p>Hope everyone has a wonderful New Years!</p>

<p>@gfx: That definitely makes sense because I believe you said you were Korean? I too am and I feel like we Asians have little body hair. And if you don't have much arm hair there's not a lot of hair to stand up, so it's just a bumpy texture, which is still really really nice. Are they still pretty noticeable though? I know some people where when they get goosebumps you can barely see them, and others when if they get even the smallest shiver, you can see their goosebumps a mile away. Are you pretty much covered in a layer of goosebumps all the time especially this time of year?</p>

When I'm indoors, it depends, I usually don't get goosebumps unless its under 65F.</p>

<p>@gfx: that's so funny! I guess there are a large percentage of koreans with the last name Kim though. Are you actually from Korean originally and still live there? And what temperature do you usually keep where you live? Do you usually keep it under 65F giving you goosebumps a lot? Or usually warmer? And I wish I could get people to brave the cold like you! :) I really love goosebumps on the arms especially something about the upper arm filled with goosebumps to me is really incredibly sexy! I like them everywhere but legs I'm not quite so interested in so if a girl is wearing a coat and short skirts I still think that is really incredible but not quite as much as a tank top or something that shows her huge goosebumps all over her arms!</p>

Good to see you around, too! Maybe we could chat a bit sometime. However, I cannot believe that your bf wanted you to wear a scarf and even his jacket! Must have looked quite bulky on your skinny figure ;-) Did you take them off again soon? I mean, you were cold anyway, weren't you ;-)</p>

<p>@daewongkim
My goosebumps are very fine since I have very little body hair, just like gfx has, and I regularly shave the remaining bits. I get goosebumps every time I am cold. They are my body's first reaction, before the shivering starts, my skin becomes reddish-blue or my lips turn blue. They become the more pronounced the colder I am. When I am sick, especially with a fever, I am much colder, but since I do not put on more clothes then, my goosebumps get bigger as well.</p>

<p>@gfx: That's interesting. Do you happen to just be colder in the morning and evenings? I know that some people wake up really chilled or really hot. Does the time of day affect the temperature? And if you don't mind me asking, what about when you're sleeping? Do you also strip down and use minimal blankets and coverings? Do you usually let your teeth chattering put you to sleep and the intense goosebumps all over kind of act as your blanket? ;)</p>

<p>@lissy w: It seems like goosebumps are people's first reaction to cold usually. I know some people who almost never get goosebumps though and frankly kind of annoys me! ;) I have a really really close friend who actually is starting to freeze for me, I can push her further and further each time. But she just tenses up and crosses her arms and shakes gently usually even if she is extremely cold. I've seen her get light goosebumps once and never heard her teeth chatter. She has quite hairy arms especially on her forearms. Do you get more intense goosebumps in certain areas? Like your upper arms, forearms, legs etc.?</p>

<p>Hi,
Thanks for sharing all your amazing stories from the cold winter! I have never seen any lady braving the cold in Sweden, where I live, like you do; gfx, lissy and mascorta! On the other hand, we can enjoy amazing moments in spring time when the sun starts to shine after the long winter and people gather on the rocks near the coast, trying to get some sun tan. </p>

<p>You know, the sea water is quite salty up here and there is a saying that you get a more “vibrant” sun tan if you first take a plunge in the salty water and then let the wind dry your body so the salt crystals remains on the skin. The sun rays will then reflect in the salt and the tanning will be more intense. </p>

<p>Therefore, on the first warm and sunny day in spring you can see ladies (all ages) forcing themselves to get into the chilly water, 10-12 C (50-54F) just wearing minimal bikini and then getting up covered in goosebumps! They stand up and let the water evaporate before they lay down to warm the body in the sun. The goosebumps come and go on the skin as the temperature varies in the winds! After an hour its time to add more salt and the bravest ladies take the second dip for the day and get even bigger goosebumps as the body is colder than the first time.</p>

<p>@lissy w: Yea it would be nice to chat with you :) haha it is sooo cold up here in NY recently. My bf likes to see me look sexy but I'm pretty sure he doesn't want me to get hypothermia lol It did look bulky on my skinny figure, but I only had it on for like 5-10 minutes to get home and I took it off the second we got there. And you're right, I was still freezing cold regardless lol</p>

<p>@DaewongKim: Yea, I am just colder in the morning and evenings. When I sleep, I only have a tank top and short shorts on (same as when I'm outside lol). I have minimal blankets that are very thin and barely warms me up, just enough so that I can fall asleep since I have a hard time falling asleep while shivering and chattering teeth. My goosebumps is probably my best blanket though :)</p>

<p>@ Chilly and Joyce: I am holding up fine, thanks for your concern. Yesterday was like the first day in years where I finally had to give in and put on a jacket since the wind was so strong, my bare arms couldn't take it. However, I still went bare legs though to show off my skinny thighs even in arctic temperatures. It was super challenging since my legs were getting numb and turning redish/bluish a minute after I walked outside and my teeth was chattering really hard. I wish I could've done better but at least I made it to work and got back alive with bare legs! Everyone on the streets and at work were so shocked to see me wearing a 10-inch long miniskirt only lol :) Even my bf and my sister who knows that I dress minimally all the time were shocked that I was able to brave the cold so well :)</p>

<p>@gfx: Yes we have been experience record breaking temperatures here in the Midwestern USA because of the extreme cold and wind, so I have been thinking about you and wondering how both you and lissy w are dealing with this. I was shocked to read that you still went out with bare legs. I am beyond amazed!! </p>

<p>That I have to say is extremely sexy that you would make yourself cold even when you sleep! So you have pretty much constant goosebumps all night long? Do you get chills right when you wake up because you've been cold all night? Or have you ever woken up in the middle of the night freezing like shivering uncontrollably, extreme teeth chattering and extreme goosebumps even worse than usual just because you got so cold? Assuming you've slept together, your boyfriend is very lucky to have you to sleep with! :)</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I have spent only a few nights together despite several years of dating, but I remember one night in January we spent together she just couldn't get warm, so we had to cuddle all night long and she was still shaking uncontrollably with some of the biggest goosebumps I've ever felt until she finally fell asleep! </p>

<p>Yea, its been extremely cold recently, thanks for your concerns! Tbh, I was a bit scared to go bare legs at first but I didn't have any pants or leggings at home, all I had were short shorts and miniskirts and I didn't want to buy pants just for a day or two or have my sister come give me pants. So I just went with it and went outside bare legs. It was soooo freezing cold and the wind kept blowing my skirt up too! My legs were completely numb by the time I got to work.</p>

<p>And yea, I am almost always cold and I definitely have goosebumps when I sleep. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and in the morning, I immediately start shivering since my body is pretty cold. When I wake up in the middle of the night, I start shivering so bad that I often wake my bf up and then he has to warm me up by rubbing on my goosebumps with his warm hands so we could both get back to sleep.</p>

<p>You've mentioned a sister to me before, if you don't mind me asking, does she do the same thing while sleeping? Like does she also let her goosebumps be the main type of warmth? How does that feel though to be constantly covered in goosebumps while you try to sleep? Do you just get used to it? Can you describe the coldest you have ever been in bed? Like how intense were the goosebumps, did your teeth chatter? how long did it take to finally warm up etc. And how do you stay cold in the summer time?</p>

<p>@Daewong Kim: Thanks lol My sister isn't as interested in braving the cold as I am. She is also not thin enough to look her best in minimal clothes. I measure if someone is thin enough by seeing if they could put their fingers around their upper arm and if they could put both hand's fingers around the upper part of their thighs and if they have a flat stomach. I think my sister is only passing the thighs test right now because she's a runner lol I have trained her a bit to brave the cold but she's unwilling to wear minimal clothes under 0C or sleep without blankets because she thinks she gets too cold. However, she does wear tank tops and short shorts all the time inside the house :) </p>

<p>I actually like the feeling of goosebumps, it keeps my body active. It could be a bit hard to fall asleep while you're so busy shivering but I got used to it after a while. The coldest I've ever been in bed is probably when I'm sick lol I would be shivering uncontrollably with chattering teeth and my bf would have to warm me up a bit before I can sleep. </p>

<p>In the summer, it gets hard to stay cold and I often can't since I have to go outside where it is hot and everyone is dressed like me. It sucks but I have to put up with it. The only thing I really do to keep my endurance is by taking cold showers which could get me shivering a lot. Only good thing about the summer is that it gives me an opportunity to tan a bit since my skin is too pale without some tanning.</p>

<p>@Joyce: The days before weren't too bad since the temperature dropped like 40F in one day. So the days before were around 30-40F which I can bare pretty well :) My favorite temperatures are from 50-70F but I am good wearing tank tops and short shorts above 20F with goosebumps and shivering and redish/bluish skin. If it gets to 0F like that day, it becomes super challenging. </p>

<p>People on the streets and train are all super shocked to see someone wearing just a tank top and short shorts (although I did have a scarf on to look fashionable) in freezing temperatures and many people, like you are curious to how I do it. I have been asked many times before "Aren't you freezing cold in that" to which I always respond, "Yes, but I enjoy it." I've also gotten a lot of compliments from people about my thin figure and my ability to brave the cold. My coworkers and friends are used to seeing me dressed like this so they don't ask and simply admire me :)</p>

<p>@gfx: Wow, it is admirable how you went to work in a miniskirt and bare-legged in such freezing weather :-) Do you think you could have managed without a jacket and scarf (which you only wore for fashion anyway) and bared some more skin?  The more goosebumps, shivering, and bluish skin, the sexier ;-) And the more of your cute thin figure is visible through your thin and tight tank top, unless you cover it, hehe! :-) Well, maybe next time *g*</p>

<p>I wish we had those temperatures here - I wore a sequined cropped top and black leather miniskirt for New Year's Eve. I spent several hours outside in the streets to celebrate and finally watch the fireworks, but we only had a mellow 42F with occasional rain showers and wind over here. Nevertheless, I had goosebumps almost right away and started getting cold by ten. I was no longer able to subdue my shivering by eleven, and people kept asking me all the time whether I was not cold wearing so little ;-). I answered, yes, but I feel great, and I am in the mood to party, and so is my dress. If they were male, I added: "Or would you prefer me to cover up?" *g* When the fireworks and cheers had ended, my feet, despite being somewhat numb from the cold, started to hurt, so I took off my strappy sandals and went barefoot. Wow, now the cold from the pavement really crept up my legs and I could not stop shivering so hard I almost fell over ;-). I had a bit of coughs and sneezes that did not exactly help me in keeping my balance either ;-) New Year's Day was different though, it rained all day with gusts of wind and temps hovering just above freezing. I watched the parade, dressed in a black bandeau top and denim hot pants. I still was a bit sick and I was soo freezing despite our temperatures being far above yours, but that is another story :-)</p>

<p>Hi Lissy,</p>

<p>nice story and for sure the part from New Year's Day will be even more interesting - so eager to read about.
Now finally the weather becomes a little bit colder in Germany as well - depending if you live more in the west or the east.</p>

<p>What do you prefer, the milder weather or more extreme? If it is more important for you to show of your body, with milder weather conditions you don't have to suffer as much but with temperatures around 0Â°C you will still outdo other girls with your style. Or is it more about prooving your stamina to you and others so you prefer to have the temperature as cold as possible and to take the challenge. I still believe that you suffer quite a lot after some time although you won't agree to others.)</p>

<p>Hi gfx,
what was the most challenging situation this winter? Did you ever come next to your limits or had to give up and confess you have to dress up/return home?</p>

<p>Yesterday here in Nashville, it was a dreary cold, gray, and rainy day.  It was probably about 38*F here yesterday afternoon.  I was at the Aldi store down in south Nashville when I observed an attractive woman there wearing SHORTS!!  It has been such a long, cold, drab, gray winter here that it was certainly a treat to see a great pair of female legs completely bare for no apparent reason!  To whomever you are, thank you for wearing shorts yesterday.  You certainly brightened up my day!  It was freezing cold yesterday, and drizzly, too.  I was wearing layers myself.  It definitely made my day to see that woman wearing shorts!</p>

<p>@firepoint - I was stranded at the wrong airport in the US just before Christmas and the plane left with my baggage leaving me in just a polo shirt and sleeveless fleece at 21F (-6C) and a few inches of snow. I had to wait a few hours at the airport before I could leave. Imagine my surprise and joy when I saw a young woman who had just arrived by plane walk out of the terminal building wearing the shortest white shorts you can imagine and the flimsiest silver flip-flops. I watched with interest as she walked out into several inches of slushy snow, her near bare feet disappearing beneath the icy slush. She never even hesitated. Not sure where she was heading - not for a taxi. I later managed to travel by bus and train to finally reach my destination the following day, spending several hours in cold railway stations. Someone even offered me a jacket but I refused. Earlier in the week I had walked around a frozen lake in a sleeveless T-shirt. It was sunny at 17F (-8C) with some wind at times. Everyone else was so wrapped up. I wanted to go for a swim but the ice was too thick. It was a lovely day. I'd never had bare arms in such low temperatures before - it was great!</p>

<p>@gfx: I think it's really incredible that you've stuck to your dress code all winter in such low temperatures. I guess you've given yourself no choice since you don't own any warm clothes. People must give you the strangest looks. I'm so pleased you're enjoying such low temperatures. Here in the UK it's really quite mild, though very wet.</p>

<p>@lissy w: Thanks :) I don't think I could've managed that day without a jacket. I actually walked out the door with a tank top carrying my jacket but within a minute, my entire body was bluish and felt numb as I shivered uncontrollably. Putting the jacket on still didn't help so much though since my legs were still freezing cold! Pretty sure I was the only girl in the entire city with bare legs that day! I agree with you though, the less clothes, the better ppl could see my thin figure :) I really liked your New Years Eve story btw. </p>

<p>@ferfred: That story on page 114 basically answers your question lol</p>

<p>@firepoint525: I liked your story. That's part of the reason I dress minimally, I want to make people's day :) </p>

<p>@wildswimmer: yep, I have no choice, all the warm clothes in my apartment belongs to my bf lol I get plenty of strange looks everywhere but I bet most of them are out of admiration. There's plenty of ppl that come up to me and ask how am I not cold and I always tell them I am but I like my body and they smile with agreement. It does get pretty challenging though especially for this winter where every day is basically below freezing, I'm losing weight just from all the shivering!</p>

Also, I've been borrowing my bfs winter jackets much more than I wanted this winter :( At least I'm keeping up with the bare legs though :D</p>

<p>Hi All,
Agreed some guys just luv to see girls shiver.  Some girls dress to please their guys or have rules that requires them to wear minimal clothing regardless of the year.</p>

<p>I tend to wear micro minis after work and wear pantyhose often.  While pantyhose offers some warmth, lets face it, anything see through is not going to provide that.
But I accept it.  However when sitting down on a bench or cold car seat in a micro, there really isn't any dress or skirt material to sit on. <br />
So two thin layers of nylon (panties and pantyhose), one gets cold pretty easily.
Beauty knows no bounds!!  Haha.</p>

<p>Even at my apartment, I have to wear minimal clothing.  sometimes just a babydoll PJ (if lucky with pantyhose) and go out on the balcony.  Freezing!</p>

<p>Anyway that is my input in the nice long thread.
For those who might:  amy.hose@yahoo.com
Cheers
Amy</p>

<p>Thank You for the welcome!  What a long active and interesting thread.</p>

<p>The short answer is both.
The long answer is girls in general as we all know tend to dress to attract, perhaps outduel the other girls, buried deep inside our DNA (announce our femininity), and cultural pressures.  So therein lies the personal part.  So I do.
And yes I do it in part b/c a certain someone likes to have rules for me, and I want to please him, so I do.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>How do you find the answer interesting?
wearing micros or nanos is sexy and fun but at times just cold!  I struggle to pull down my hem, haha, in vein as the hems are soooooooooo short there isn't any to pull down.</p>

<p>Guys luv to see girls struggle to cover up be it warm or cold.  But it seems cold somehow is better?  It seems that some girls (that would be me) go along with rules and suggestions on how to dress.  We don't want to say no in fear of not pleasing.</p>

<p>I guess the coldest is when you sit down and only what you have on your bottoms is between your butt and the cold .  Even if standing you can feel the cold air swirl around your $%!@ and butt.  Maybe it give the guys a sense of dom over the girl in that she is going along with his wishes.  And she in the same way.</p>

<p>I don't know.  I'm not making any sense, am I?
Sorry about the rambling.

thank you for your compliments.  that is flattering.
so what do we girls do in the warmth?
or is that another thread?
I think it is all connected for reasons listed above.
I dress in skimpy clothes partly b/c of rules, partly b/c of dna driven inside, partly b/c of culture
anyone who denies this, tell me where I am wrong
I don't want to come across as ...

<p>Hello guys!</p>

<p>Just a quick heads up: I'm still happy and alive but was (and quite am) actually a little too busy and distracted to post over the last months. </p>

<p>Winter has been extremely soft and my training (as the regular readers might know) has been quite effective. However I got my share of cold rain and heavy winds at near zero temperatures. Some stories will follow when I find the time. </p>

<p>gfx's "photo of herself" also features on a Chinese porn site and a Korean dating site. The search is not an image search using text, it's Google's search by uploading the image - it searches for similar or identical images. I'm sure gfx feels quite proud of himself for fooling us for so long.</p>

<p>@Macaw! - just use basic html tags - fancy stuff doesn't work, but simple tags do. This is also great for links. </p>

<p>&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt; gives you <i>italics</i></p>

<p>I would also suggest to stop all requests for videos and images of freezing females (especially those for sending them to a private mail account).</p>

<p>If somebody has something to share, I guess he would just post a direct link - unless he's a complete idiot. </p>

<p>My name is Nadine and I leave in Switzerland (sorry for English mistakes). I have been married for 10 years and our couple is doing great. I found the topic on that forum very interesting as it relates to my own experience and issue.</p>

<p>After being married , I  quickly realized that my husband was much more happy when I was wearing skirts and dresses than pants. To please him, I stopped completely wearing pants (not a single one in my wardrobe today). Then, he told me that what he would really like is me to go bare legs at all times. This is what I have been doing for many seasons now, summer is OK as most girls do that, but winter is of course an issue. The trade-off I could find is to often wear knee-high boots with my skirts as opposed to usual open female shoes, meaning that my feet and ankle are usually covered and only my thighs are left bare.  I found that wearing boots makes a huge difference when it is really cold, it is much more manageable.Bare feet in snowy wheather is one of the worst thing I can think of. The photo that was recently posted with the girl wearing a pleated skirt with snow on the ground  is exactly how I have been dressed many, many times...and you REALLY feel the cold when dressed like that, from the bottom to the very top of your legs, believe me. Even if you dress like this everyday, you don't get used to it and you hate those moment when you'll have to stand outside, like waiting for the bus, in the cold. Forget about the wind that makes things 10 times worse.</p>

<p>Are they women around who have the same "soft pressure" from their husband ? Do you, like myself, feel  "unconfortable" because  dressed in an appropriate way (specially when with other woman who really dress according to the wheather and ask you questions) ? More practically, how do you manage when it is freezing cold?</p>

<p>If you are a men with the same envy as my husband (which I fully respect), why is this so important to you ? Does it make such a big difference how your girlfriends are dressed ? </p>

<p>Nadine, I am a man who also likes women cold like your husband, but I also like to be cold myself.  I also don't like lots of clothes, it just seems wrong to cover ourselves up a lot.  We were not born with clothes, we are not meant to wear them.  Our bodies can handle all sorts of temperatures if we'd only let them get used to it.  I always wear the minimum so as not to draw too much attention, but I never wear clothes for warmth, and I don't heat my house apart from to stop the damp.</p>

<p>hello nadine,
welcome to the forum :-)
i am a man ... and i gladly give you my view of this fetish. for me, a skimpy dressed woman is a big turn on. my favorite rule is "i should always be able to see all and any items of clothing my girl is wearing". which entails ... no bra, no panties, no stockings or hose of any kind, no socks. just one layer of fabric that does not necessarily cover too much. i just love to have easy access to her skin! and if the girl proudly shows off her flesh even if the elements recommend otherwise and heavy goose bumps and erect nipples clearly show that the girl is cold, it is all the more sexy! the distinction between my barely clad girl and the heavily dressed people around adds another kick. wearing a wicked weasel on the nude beach is not the same as in a snow covered shopping street downtown zurich. however, the girl must ENJOY what she is doing (for me) and even better get aroused herself by exposing her flesh in the cold. i cannot stand if she shows a sour face or is complaining all the time, then it is simply no fun.
the accounts of lissy w and laloli on this board are probably the hottest, and coalburner is of course a league of her own.

<p>Welcome to the group, Nadine. Hopefully you can try shorter and shorter boots this winter, but I agree with Chillly, if you don't enjoy it yourself then it's no turn on for me. I'm male. I like being cold myself. I have done ever since I was a small child. I notice that many small children like wearing few clothes but their parents beat it out of them at a young age with scare stories about getting ill. I spent most of my teens wearing far too many clothes for fear that someone would suspect that I enjoyed being cold and think I was weird. In fact I thought I was weird myself until I discovered this group but I gradually came not to care what other people think.</p>

<p>Being cold myself is a big turn on for me, and as big a turn on is to see women who like being cold themselves. If they are skimpily dressed it looks nice, especially if they are thin too, but it is completely spoilt if they are complaining about it and not enjoying it. I've actually never got to know any female, or any male for that matter, who shares my feeling - only the people in this group. And there are not many females in this group who get cold because they want to. Most are coerced into it by men they know. If they're not enjoying it they should put some warm clothes on!</p>

<p>I'm a firm believer that anyone can enjoy the cold once they've got used to it.  It's like exercise, people are generally lazy and don't want to do it.  But once you get into the swing of it, it becomes fun and makes you feel full of energy all the time.  The same goes for the cold.  If I've been cold recently, I feel much more energetic for the next few days.  It really annoys me when people say being cold can make you ill (or even kill you - WTF? - we're warm blooded, even if we feel cold on the outside, we are always warm inside.)  Cold makes you healthier, it toughens you up.  It also burns 400-800 calories an hour on top of whatever you're already burning if you're exercising aswell.  And if you're lazy, then just laze around in the cold and burn calories with no effort!</p>

<p>Someone who really freezes and suffers, I don't call that sexy.</p>

<p>I live in Canada and sometimes see a few girls or women showing their midriff or going bare legged in the street below zero in winter, e.g. in -4F weather with a freezing -20F windchill (-20C real temp. and -30 windchill). But they look to feel good as they wear warm boots and parkas. </p>

<p>I have a freezer for myself - both to cool off in summer, to shiver in winter, and believe it or not to lose weight - being cold burns a LOT of calories with no effort at all.  Take one decent sized chest freezer, line with rubber pond liner (not the cheap plastic stuff, the thicker rubber version or it'll leak if it gets scratched, I use the same stuff for my garden pond, it's cat claw proof).  Fill freezer with water.  Buy a thermostat with waterproof remote sensor (as the freezer's one doesn't go high enough and the water will freeze solid) and plug the freezer into it.  Put the sensor between the liner and the freezer wall (so it's out of the way and isn't continuously underwater - it says waterproof but I've heard that before).  I put it on a thin plank of wood so it's not touching the freezer wall, but instead touching the liner.  If it touches the wall it'll sense it much colder while the freezer runs, this way it gets the water temperature.  Set to whatever temperature you like.  If you want below zero, add salt to the water and mix thoroughly, you can get salt water to -21C if you put enough of it in!  Site the freezer near a TV set so you can sit in it for hours without getting bored.</p>

<p>For me, it is especially sexy to see a woman baring mostly her lower body (legs, butt, etc.) on a cold day, like in this example by Christine:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6fUaKc_5KE</p>

<p>When I was in high school, the cheerleaders would come to school on cold days (on game days) wearing their letter jackets or letter sweaters over their uniforms, but leaving their legs completely bare and exposed to the cold.  I often wondered why they did this.  Did they not have leggings that they could wear, or were they not allowed to wear them, or did they just really like showing off their legs, no matter how cold it got?  </p>

<p>Hi, I'm Lena</p>

<p>I also got into wearing skimpy outfits despite the weather in the last two to three years.
When I still went to school, it was more difficult because when it was cold, my mum always wanted me to leave the house wearing trousers and a jacket. But as soon as I turned the first corner, off they came and went into my bag. I was left with a short skirt or some short shorts. On top I usually had a strappy top or another short-sleeved or sleeveless top.</p>

<p>But since I'm at university all of that has become easier. The winter was really fun, even though it wasn't very fierce. But now in the summer, I'm a bit bored again. What I don't like about summer is that many girls are wearing only little and I don't stand out any more - at least not so much.</p>

<p>I've just discovered this board and thought I'd chime in here. Are you still active? I have only skimmed some of the pages of this thread, but it seems to me that the reasons for wearing little among your are quite diverse. So I made my own poll, which also features some questions about your motivation to dress skimpily. I'd be happy if some of you took it: http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/594985</p>

<p>Hi bassdrummer and chilly,</p>

<p>thanks for the warm welcome. Yes, I'm from Germany, southern Germany actually. But I'm not interested in meeting people from the internet I don't even know. Sorry, chilly.</p>

<p>I take it that both of you are guys and like your girls to be freezing in skimpy clothes. Can you put your finger on why you like that? And do you pity us girls when it's obvious that we are miserable? Do you even offer a girl a jacket when you think it's becoming too extreme?</p>

<p>That has happened to me quite often. But up until I have been too proud to take it. I usually respond by telling the guy that I'm alright and by pointing out that he will be cold if he gives me his jacket.</p>

<p>hi lena,</p>

<p>my impression of this forum is roughly this.</p>

<p>there are boys posting here, who have a genuine interest in the cold for beauty topic.</p>

<p>and there are wanna-be people of undetermined gender who pretend to be girls with a penchant for shivering et al. if you care to read some of the earlier pages, gfx was such a forentroll who eventually blew up. and for sure not the only one.</p>

<p>so unless and until you are willing to give me a real-life proof of who you are, you might just as well be a 59-year old male, obese, unkempt, unshaven and smelly. does nothing for my fantasies.</p>

<p>no harsh feelings &amp; and happy language training :-)

<p>This is for Lena,</p>

<p>Lena, you raised the question why we like to see freezing girls! I will try to answer from my personal opinion. 
I think it is both the behavior and the view of the girl that is attractive. The behavior is telling me that this girl is strong, lusty and healthy – all attractive qualities! She also needs to meet my preferences for a good looking girl! </p>

<p>Imagine this Perfect girl: 
She is athletic, sun tanned, wearing hot pants and a short sleeved blouse. She is with a group of people partying on the beach. Air temperature drops while the sun sets. The other girls put on some warm clothes to stop freezing while miss Perfect does not. She is smiling and does not show any sign of discomfort even though we can see that she is covered in goose bumps! 
Her well-toned muscles start to contract a little making her body firm and alert. She is enjoying every moment and a sense of well-being goes through her body when she touches her arms and legs feeling her goose bumps. She smiles and is ready to enjoy the even colder wind that starts to blow from the sea at night!    </p>

<p>Personally, I think that if she's enjoying freezing and not visibly suffering, it takes away a lot of the pleasure.   I want her to realize (or think) she's not going to get warm.  That way, she stops holding back and shivers full force.</p>

<p>The best freezing situation is when the lady torments herself to freeze in the cold because she wants to look attractive for other people!</p>

<p>Imagine a young hostess at an outdoor exhibition or something like that. It is early autumn and temperature is about 10C, air is moist and the wind is chilly. The visitors are wearing jackets and coats while the corageous hostess brave the cold just wearing a minimal but classy summer dress, revealing her soft, sun-tanned skin on arms and legs. She knows that she is an eye-catcher and she enjoys it. She didn't expect the weather to be so cold and she really has a tough time, but now she has to fulfill her duties and there is no way back.</p>

<p>She is covered in goose bumps from her well-trained calves, fit thighs to her slender arms. She would like to rub her skin to keep warm but she can't because she has to hold her posture and carry a tray with drinks without shaking. Everybody who comes near her can see her huge goose bumps on her biceps when she struggles with the heavy tray. She is doing her best to disguise all signs of discomfort with a warm smile, but we can see in her eyes that she is suffering and her body is a little stiff from freezing!</p>

<p>I don't see the point in severe freezing torture when body temperature drops several degrees. The most pronounced goose bumps come when it is just a little too cold and the body still has a chance to resist. It is nice to see a girl struggling between the desire to take on more clothes and the pleasure to attract appreciative glances thanks to her minimal clothing. How much discomfort is she willing to withstand and does the freezing even turn her on! </p>

<p>It's really a matter of preferences.  You prefer the goosebumps (which, if I'm reading right, don't require a lot of cold for best results).  Me, I'm more interested in her shivering,which needs a lot of cold if you want more than just a little shaking.  So, no right or wrong, just different aspects.  I think.</p>

<p>Absolutely  Wolfsbane706, we are all different! </p>

<p>I think the hypothermia process is something like this: </p>

<p>When the body can't keep its ideal temperature, first reaction is to develop goose bumps to raise the body hair. Second, blood vessels near the skin will contract to prevent blood from being cooled off near the body surface. That is why we look pale while freezing. Third, the body starts to shiver to produce more heat. Fourth, body stops shivering and all internal organs slow down and we finally become unconscious. </p>

<p>So my perfect girl should just get huge goose bumps but keep her healthy skin color and not turn pale. Your perfect girl should reach much further in the hypothermia process, so she constantly shivers but should not get so low core temperature that she passes away, of course!   </p>

<p>It takes a lot of experience to control how much hypothermia you want to get, I believe.  But experimenting together with a girl of the right stuff would not hurt! 
I found a scientific paper about hypothermia,  that might give some clues: </p>

<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1841707/pdf/brmedj02134-0031.pdf</p>

<p>Here is a HD video of a nice girl freezing and shivering during Navy Seals combat training. Watch 8 min into the clip.</p>

<p>Hypothermia is overrated.  We're supposed to handle different temperatures.  Shivering is just us keeping warm, it doesn't mean we're too cold.  You wouldn't say your house is too cold because the boiler thermostat comes on.  It's maintaining the temperature.</p>

<p>Also, 37C is standard body temperature when relaxed.  36C makes us shiver.  20C or less makes us die.  So shivering is one SEVENTEENTH of the way there and no cause for concern.</p>

<p>I agree Macaw, shivering is not necessarily dangerous! </p>

<p>Danger may come when core body temperature drops several degrees, like after an “ice mile swim“ in +3C water! </p>

<p>If we could find the optimum temperature in the house, so that our girls shivers all day long in their skimpy clothes, it is perfect!          </p>

<p>I'd like to pick up <b>Wolfbane706's</b> question</p>

<p><i>So what's everyone's favorite shivering situation, fantasy or otherwise?</i></p>

<p>First what's not:</p>

<p>It's not me who is shivering ... I'm not really the kind of woman who gets a kick out of it. </p>

<p>Shivering men are of absolutely no interest for me. </p>

<p>No permanent damage should be done. I don't want a girl to die, to lose a toe or having her skin scarred. </p>

<p>Now to what I like: </p>

<p>I like two kinds of situations: The one where a girl is tough and brave. She keeps proudly smiling despite
being totally cold. </p>

<p>The other one where she is "forced" into a situation and is visibly suffering (I can be an $%!@). </p>

<p>Of course she should be pretty and preferably slim and as naked as possible. Goosebumps, shivering, 
chattering [corrected spelling, thanks Macaw!] teeth are all nice but what really turns me on, is her naked flesh in the cold and most of all 
the look in her eyes (either of pride or desperation). </p>

<p>One time, with an ex of mine, I had her take a cold shower for me. Clothed... Well kind of, because who doesn't like a bit of wet fabric clinging to a gorgeous female body hey? So she was wearing a lacy thong and a white T-shirt, short sleeves, nothing else. Would have liked some heels but didn't have any to hand. So she steps into the shower, looking nervous as I hadn't told her what I was going to do. I positioned her under the shower and said she had to stay there for a minute no matter what happened. She bit her lip and looked at me with her big brown eyes and nodded. She was pretty, Harriet, not too slim but curves in all the right places. So I turned on the water and she shrieked, grabbed her arms and started hopping from foot to foot. I started to count the 'minute' (very slowly. I'm mean) and she stood there, arms folded under her breasts pushing them up and together. Her T-shirt went see through very quickly and her nipples were pushed out rather nicely against it. Within about 10 seconds she was shivering quite a bit and hopping up and down having the result you'd expect. Anyway once the minute was up I turned the water off but there was no way I was getting her a towel. She didn't want to come out of the bathroom as the AC was on in the rest of the house so I had great fun watching her stand in the doorway shaking from head to foot, water dripping off the hem of her shirt before she finally ran for the towel cupboard upstairs. Well that was quite a sight too. </p>

<p>Yeah I know. It might have been the shock, might have been the fact the shower soaked everything pretty quickly. They were little shivers to begin with but they were there.

<p>I guess like most girls, feels the cold and shivers and stuff.</p>

<p>Guess she was in clubs and stuff most of the time but would be outside for a while hunting down cabs etc. She did walk home or to mates on occasion too which would have been an hour +.</p>

<p>Remember her coming home once the morning after a night out in just a T-shirt, barefoot in a thin layer of snow.</p>

<p>Well it took her far longer to stop shivering than it took her to start, haha. She grabbed one of the larger towels, wrapped it around herself and and first just stood there, shivering and shaking with her teeth chattering for a few minutes. She looked so cute, despite looking cold and miserable (or perhaps because of that, haha). Then she looked at me and said "Please, can't I have the AC off, just for half an hour while I get warm?". Of course I told her she looked beautiful under the AC, and she gave me a little smile with those quivering lips and said that if I liked it then she'd put up with it. We she sat at the top of the stairs for about 15 minutes, because there was least AC blowing on her there, and her shivering gradually subsided a little bit. Of course her top was still wet, and when I pointed this out she pouted a bit about having to come out of the towel to take it off, but eventually removed the towel and took her T-shirt off. Well I say took it off, peeled it off would be a better way of putting it, it was very tight, and clinging to to her body wonderfully. While she did that I threw the towel down stairs (I said I was mean) and she had to run and get it, and run back upstairs, this time without even a T-shirt to contain her ample breasts. As you can imagine that was enjoyable to watch as well, but the best bit was there's an AC unit at the bottom of the stairs, so by the time she got back up and got back into the towel the shivering was almost as bad as it was before. Anyway she sat there shaking and looking cute for about another half an hour before her hair was dry enough to put other clothes on. She'd stopped shivering when she came back downstairs, but when we had some friends over later in the evening they commented on how chilly she looked, especially for the time of year (my excuse for having the AC up so high). </p>

<p>Over here I find ice skating rinks are too warm.  Pretty daft as it must cost them more to keep the ice frozen.</p>

<p>The ice itself can be cold enough, especially if she can't skate and spends more time falling than on her feet.  If she can skate, it's not satisfying in the least unless it's at an outdoor rink while the temperature is around 0.</p>

<p>I got more bruises than cold when I last went.  I took a bunch of kids to an ice rink with the school I worked at.  The little bastards were a lot better than I was.  I got the hang of it eventually and created a game of tag, causing absolute mayhem for the other skaters.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>It's been a while, I have been busy to post, but I have been following this post carefully! ;) I modified my user name just for more anonymity purposes. </p>

<p>So I have always had a HUGE thing for goosebumps. I think they are the sexiest thing in the world, and the sensation of running your hands over them, feeling every single hair standing up gets me going like no other! I still am searching avidly for videos and pictures of goosebumps and girls freezing cold. However, I also am finding that something almost equally arousing for me is chattering teeth. I love it SO much when a girl is shivering so hard you can hear her stuttering, hear the clacking sound of her teeth from a mile away, and inevitably, she HAS to have goosebumps! </p>

<p>I thought I could share an instance I have run into recently that highlighted something like this:</p>

<p>I walking in the city and waiting for the train to take me back home. It was a crisp, cool evening, about maybe 50 degrees or so and quite windy. I'm sitting on the platform, and all of a sudden, a beautiful girl walks up. She had rich, flowing blonde hair, was about 5'10" or so, large breasts, and sexy as hell! She was wearing an extremely short sleeveless, strapless blue dress that because she was so tall looked even shorter since they barely covered her butt. She sat down, and I could see HUGE goosebumps all over her arms, chest, and legs right away. She had a lot of hair so the goosebumps were huge and the hairs stuck out like a full inch! She rubbed her arms to try to stay warm, but as the wind blew, she would get these huge shivers, and her teeth would start to chatter uncontrollably. Well, the train was very late, and she kept getting colder and colder. Eventually her body looked like it was convulsing, and her teeth were chattering so loudly and so hard I thought she was going to break a tooth or something. Then it started to rain, and as it rained because it was a bare platform, she got even colder which I didn't even think was possible. I brought and umbrella and motioned over to her to sit under it with me to stay "dry" which she eagerly accepted. The train ended up about about an hour late so during that time we just talked and got to know each other a bit. Eventually she was so desperate for warmth she was willing to cuddle with basically a stranger, and the beautiful goosebumps never left her arms even the whole train ride back. As we got on the train I could still hear her teeth chattering and see her whole body shivering like crazy. I certainly hope she warmed up eventually because I thought she was on the verge of hypothermia, but am I a terrible person because......I'm sort of glad she didn't when I was around? ;)</p>

<p>True story! I hope you enjoyed it! </p>

<p>No you're not a terrible person.  Shivering isn't dangerous.  It only takes a loss of 1-2C to shiver, but 17C to die, which shivering prevents.</p>

<p>These are such great pictures! Thank you for posting! Just curious, where do you find these? And I am having trouble opening the last one.</p>

<p>I find that living in a colder climate with seasons changing quickly allows a lot of what I call "unexpected" chills which are my favorite! ;) I find it fortunate that i happen to be in the right place at the right time a lot.</p>

<p>I love it when it's warm consistently and then all of a sudden it drops like 20 degrees. People still are expecting it be warm so they're wearing a lot of tank tops, shorts, etc. but it's cold, so there's a lot of goosebumps! </p>

<p>Any tips on where to find pics such as these?</p>

<p>Look at this site: http://vipergirls.to/forums/237-Artistic</p>

<p>New series of pictures are posted every day. 
Look for outdoor environment and if the photographer is skilled the photos are sharp enough to show goosebumps!</p>

<p>Please post links if you find something interesting!</p>

<p>The best place I've found to see people shivering live is this assault course, when it's run in winter.  4000 people swimming in ice cold water and crawling through mud fora  couple of hours, and a lot of them not wearing very much.  Watching them all shiver at the end is great fun!  Many of them stand in the showers almost (or completely) naked, shaking like mad.  http://www.toughguy.co.uk</p>

<p>See it's not too difficult for me since I live in a relatively cold place. I am having trouble finding people shivering with goosebumps in the internet. I find that grocery stores in the summertime blasting the AC, or specifically places where it's cold inside yet it's warm outside and women are wearing next to nothing. I find that it's so sexy when a girl is wearing like a tank top and short shorts because it's like 95 outside, then walks into a place where it's freezing, and you can see the goosebumps right away covering her entire body, shivering like crazy with her teeth chattering.</p>

<p>Teeth chattering is something else that is really interesting lately. What sources would anyway have for videos of girls chattering their teeth?</p>

<p>It depends on the person too! Sometimes I find that certain girls will get goosebumps really easily, without even having to be that cold, but almost never chatter their teeth. Other girls, almost never get goosebumps, but their teeth will chatter easily. But the best is when both happen frequently! :) I have a friend who it could be the middle of summer and if a breeze comes by, she'll sometimes get a big shiver and goosebumps will be everywhere! And if we go inside a store or restaurant and it's maybe 68F or so and she forgot a jacket or sweatshirt, she'll almost certainly have goosebumps and will be shivering like crazy the whole time. </p>

<p>Hi! I'm a new user, mid-twenties girl from Eastern Europe. I always wear little clothing. I enjoy all the looks I get, specially in winter time. And enjoy my bare skin getting exposed to cold wind and air.
If anyone is interested I can give some details.

<p>Dear Lorna,</p>

<p>Yes sure I am interested in hearing more about how you deal with the cold!</p>

<p>Do you try to look unaffected from the cold like it was summer, even if it hurts and you are covered in goose bumps?</p>

<p>Do you avoid protection from rain and cold wind even if you have the oppurtunity at a bus stop, for example?</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing your stories!</p>

<p>I try to act as if I didn't feel the cold.
I keep my legs and arms bare most of the time. But when it gets really cold (below 0 C) I wear a sweater but I keep my legs completely bare all time. I only wear very short shorts or mini skirts so my legs remain naked. Many people look at me and even make remarks and ask questions.
I am waiting for the winter! Hope it will be colder than last year to get more attention for my naked legs!</p>

<p>Hi Lorna. Welcome to the thread. Maybe this winter when it drops below zero you could try wearing a short-sleeved sweater instead of a long-sleeved one, or maybe a sleeveless gilet over a T-shirt? That would look even cooler. What's your coldest moment?</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>Yes I try to wear sleeveless gillet over a T-shirt but when it gets really cold, my arms can't take it. I'll try again this year.
Where I live it's still over 10 C so I am only wearing very short shorts and sleeveless shirts  that show some midriff.
I think my coldest moment was maybe 3 years ago when I spent a whole winter day (very cold one) outside in tiny little shorts. My legs were red and blue by the evening.</p>

<p>Hey guys I read something not realistic but entertaining randomly,
http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/Drive-Nude-And-Walk-In-The-Woods-Nude/2394299?n=0&amp;aok=Confirm</p>

<p>I Drive Nude And Walk In The Woods Nude
Young Girl's Extreme Winter Nudity Experience At first I have to start with me, that this project requires to give also self-experience. I have practiced winter nudity many years, but not regularly. There have been some pauses. I have been lucky to share winter nude walk with some girls, like here: http://www.nudeimagehost.com/viewer.php?file=56243058045088081241.jpg. This is my photos and my car can be seen in picture.
In previous winter I began from 1st January and then every weekend, but not only the coldest (4-5 Feb), from which I wrote main story later. Longest time was at 26th February 1 h 47 min and temperature in this day about -4-5 (23-25 F), but sunny. Feeling of cold is not the same every time. Generally it can be very different. But normally after some 30-40 minutes is the warmest moment, then you don't feel any cold. After some 1 h – 1h 15 min body started to feel colder again, but not too much. Nevertheless that means body have already frozen and feelings will be maybe better later, but interests of the health you must finish nude winter walk. I must admit, that I walk in winter not totally naked, but with ski hat, gloves and sports shoes.
But until 2010 december I didn't know that there is one girl, who had practiced winter nudism since five years old and had achieved much better results, that anybody can imagine. I met her accidentally and very luckily – this was during one of my many winter naked walks. On forest trail I suddenly saw, that somebody is coming towards me. That was not surprise, because I have met some people during the walks, only reactions have been different. But now I was bewildered, because I saw naked girl coming on the same track.
Obviously we talked some minutes, because seeing other person do same thing is interesting. Unlike me girl was totally naked – not even shoes, barefooted. She allowed me touch her skin, and it was shockingly warm, although she told has been about hour in forest. After conversation she give her cell phone number, because she told, that her parents don't allow her to go naked walk and I maybe can help to fulfill her dreams about extreme winter nudity.
Briefly her story was, that father exercised her from 5-year old get used to cold. She ran in snow and then spells were every time longer. At 8 years old she was able to spend about hour naked in winter conditions. But when she became 9 years old in next winter, father said: „No way you go naked anymore. Until now we continue steeling in swimsuit only.“ Girl claimed, that it was not same experience anymore and she started later secretly go to walk again stark-naked, as it was on day of our meeting. She was 13 then.
If some our winters were mild, then 2011 February was cold. And we agreed, that in 24th February, which was holiday, girl says to parent that she have one event with friends, but actually she will take record naked walk in this day despite of temperature. And it was cold day: about 10.45, when starting, temperature in forest was -19 (about -2 F). Our aim was to walk 2 hours and I was dressed warmly in contrast to girl. Only I insisted, that she have to start with shoes and then decide, when to continue barefooted.
But it was sunny day and temperature was rising every minute. I check it out now and it was -15,8 at noon and -12,4 at 1 p.m. Look temperatures here. (http://www.emhi.ee/index.php?ide=21&amp;ts=1298541600&amp;go=4). As I expected, girl was not feeling much cold and took the boots off soon. She said, that barefooted is simply more comfortable. After two hours she said, that its not a problem to continue experience, but we finished at 13.22. It means 2 hours 37 min.
Our last winter was in the beginning very mild, in December not even below zero temperatures (32 F). Girl was talking, that in this winter she tries to do something extraordinary, what she have never done – to spend all day naked outside. But she was waiting colder temperatures to get this experience more harsh. At the end of January it was quickly getting colder and weather forecast predicted extreme cold – about -25-30 (-14-22 F) in morning and maybe -20 afternoon. When I called to girl, she was very excited and almost overjoyed about prediction and we choose 4th February to this naked day. Look here temperatures in morning: (http://www.emhi.ee/index.php?ide=21&amp;ts=1328421600&amp;go=1).
Girl insisted, that all walk will take part only in her terms. 1) Walk starts approximately at sunrise and finish at sunset, it was from 8.13 am to 4.42 p.m. 2) All clothes and also boots must be left in car.
She asked friend with to witness her experience, but it was mistake, because we had problems with other girl. I asked my friend to came and recording all activities as the evidence.
Morning was extremely cold. All ski events in this day were cancelled, and it took 5 minutes to get car started. I put maximum clothes on: special winter boots with two pair of socks, two pair of trousers, shirt, blouse, sweater, jersey and warm jacket, special wool hat and gloves. Experiment girl's friend had somewhat less right clothing and problems started.
Walk began at 8.11 – we reached right time. At temperature -30,5 (-23 F) girl was feeling extreme cold at first 20 minutes. She said, that breathing was not ok, but she tried to improve the situation. Also she was walking mainly in thick snow, because the surface layer of snow was colder. Often she jumped into snow, and made some exercises, herself lying in snow.
Weather was not getting any warmer to 9 a.m, only a little bit (-30,1). And then it happened – naked girl's friend said, that she can't stand the cold longer. My friend had to go immediately to cottage (our walk's half-point and finish point) with other girl, and we agreed to meet again at half-point and then he continues filming.
The sun began to shine between the trees and girl's self-condition improved slowly. „Now the harder part is over and hopefully I can soon enjoy my walk,“ she said. „But it was really cold, I didn't expect this. It is pity, that my friend didn't withsstand.“
About 10.30 we reached near river, which was partially ice-free because of sources. I suggested girl to swim a little bit, because in this case water temperature was warming her. She was really happy in water, splashed and swam. When she came out of water, she was warmed up. „What a great pleasure,“ she said. „I am here middle of the winter and now began to feel comfortable.“
After 11.00 we reached a small village. We wanted to include some public nudity experience to winter walk. Girl was again very excited, but she didn't know yet reaction of the people, which later made her cry.
One older lady was first to notice us. She didn't believe her eyes and started shout and ran out of our way. After that news about naked girl spread throughout the village and despite of cold weather more and more people came out of the house. One man asked: „Is it joke or something? What you are thinking himself?“ We explained, that girl is doing experience and will be naked all day. Then another one pointed: „If she stands cold, as you said, why she don't wear panties or swimsuit? How old she is? It is inappropriate and ill-mannered behaving from such young girl!“
Girl was feeling like devastated. Nobody said anything about her courage. Girl tried to say something to protect herself: „You don't understand, that I am not feeling shame being naked. It's your problem.“ But it was like oil poured into the fire. People get more angry and somebody named girl a <strong><em>*. And then poor girl started to cry: „I am not a *</em></strong>!“.
We had to leave village quickly. For me it was unreasonable, that NOBODY said anything about girl's courage, only they repeated like robots: „Wear panties and bra!“ Absolutely irrational situation: girl was going naked on -25C and people even were not surprised!
Poor girl felt cold again, because she was devastated about people's reaction. She was all shivering and I offered to finish experience and to give her some my clothes and go quickly to cottage. But girl replied: „No! I can handle!“ She did some quick yoga exercises and strongly focused to eliminate the feeling of cold. And that 5-minute effort was worth of it – girl was not shivering anymore and forgot disappointment of people's response.
We arrived to the cottage at noon. Temperature was now „only“ -21. My friend and girls friend, now warmed up, were waiting and also temperature inside cottage has reached until +10 (52 F). I asked: „This has lasted almost 4 hours. Come in and put the clothes back on!“
„No!“ replied girl again resolutely. „But I need some rest after walking over 10 kilometres. Bring something from house, on which I can sit!“
We brought chair and also made for her hot tea. Funny, if someone had seen this weird situation: warmly dressed men enjoy brief stop on house and let naked girl to sit outside! But these were the rules. Other girl had some talk with experiment girl and when she came back to house, she told: „Kate was very upset about people's reaction, but she is really brave! She is happy now and warmed also.“
We made rest some 25 minutes and then continued walk to other part of forest. We had to go through snowy path and then trail over frozen marsh, which sparkled beautifully in cold weather. It was southern part of natural park. „It is like wild beauty, more interesting part of trip. You can maybe enjoy a nature,“ I said to girl. „I never had been here,“ she answered. „But I have heard, that is beautiful.“
„The sun heats a lot,“ said girl after some 4 kilometres, when we arrived on trees-free marsh. „I am now hot again.“ This was like miracle – girl really have not anymore frozen body. At 2 p.m temperature was rising to -19 – warmest time in that day. We soon started our way back through other way, but before that we met one biologist (woman) skiing on marsh with son and daughter, about the same age as our girl.
Kate was little bit frightened again, but biologist was very kind-hearted and praised girl. „See, how good health she has. But my children are so often ill and not prepared. Therefore I took them today to nature, though warmly dressed,“ laughed she hilariously. She never mentioned absence of pants, although her boy was present. „This is quite an achievement,“ she says about girl's extreme winter experience, but was not really stricken. „If to practice, everything is possible,“ she concluded calmly and we leave biologist family.
End of our trip was too routine, there was nothing more to describe. We finished exactly according to plan at 4.42 p.m. After sitting some time in cottage and Kate getting her clothes back we leave at home again. There were difficult moments, but she get over and kept her promise.</p>

<p>Hello Chilly,</p>

<p>Sorry but I say no for real life encounter.
I live in one of your neighbours capital.
This morning when I went to work, on the crowded bus there was a very nice tall girl standing next to me (I like both girls and boys) wearing leather trousers. In the crowd she was pushed next to me so the leather fabric touched my bare skin on the legs (I have mini jeans shorts on today) - I know it's nothing special but I still have shivers if I think about. We stayed like that for quite a long time, I don't know if she felt it, she didn't even look at me.</p>

<p>Thanks Goosebumps,</p>

<p>I am trying to answer all your questions:</p>

<p>How do you prepare for a cold day?  - I don't do any special preparation, I use moisturising creams all year as my skin is a bit dry, so I use more of them in winter as my naked skin exposed to the cold gets drier. And before going to bed I select the clothes I will wear the next day - I have a nice collection of shorts and short skirts!</p>

<p>Do you also have low temperature in your home, so you are always used to low temperature? - I live alone and I am always naked in my appartment. I am not very rich so I try to save money on heating. I turn it off most of the time and as the walls connect to the neighbours who heat, my flat stays quite warm (aroun 18-19 C).</p>

<p>Do you always have goose bumps when you are outdoors in the cold and does it happen that you even shiver occasionally? - Sometimes I have goosebumps but not that often, don't know why. It happens that when I leave my house I get goosebumps immediately but then they go away. I do shiver only if it is really cold.</p>

<p>Can you avoid that hands and feet hurts and get numb because of diminished blood flow? - Most time I wear open sandals but when it's below -5 C I wear warm shoes. My hands get numb, I can't avoid that.</p>

<p>You have practiced a lot to reach your level of cold resistance, haven t you? - As we were poor when I was a girl my mother could only by cheap tights for me that I hated so I preferred to go bare legged even in winter. That was my practice.</p>

<p>I can hardly wait for this winter!</p>

<p>Lorna, you are absolutely brilliant!</p>

<p>You have obviously trained your body to heat in a unique way! What you have achieved is so impressive because you are always in cold conditions! A winter swimmer takes a short plunge and warms the body in thick clothes afterwards. You can obviously live your normal life all day long and dress like other girls only do on hot summer days, even if temperature is just above 0C! And when you come home to your +18C flat, you prefer to completely undress!  That is the spirit! </p>

<p>And when other people is wearing thick winter coats as a protection from the cold and damp wind, you just look at your bare arms and maybe see some sporadic goose bumps and you think it would be nice if winter would be really cold this year!</p>

<p>I am amused of the contrasts that you create when your beautiful and seemingly fragile body, with so much bare skin exposed, meets the rough, cold and harsh environment! You are cool and enjoy every moment, which adds to the exciting contrast! </p>

<p>People in your neighborhood doesn t know how privileged they are to see you in town! </p>

<p>Thanks for taking your time and answering my questions in last message! </p>

<p>Thanks Laura and gbf, you are really nice. 
Yes I really enjoy all the moments when I can let my skin get exposed to the cold!
Just a note on my neighbourhood that you mentioned: maybe 2 years ago I went home, I live in a flat in a house of 12 flats. I stopped on the ground floor opening a letter I just received. On the 2nd floor 2 teenage boys just left their apartments and started to talk about me - one said that he saw me that morning with bare legs in short shorts. The other said I must wear body coloured tight - they discussed about it agreeing I had nice legs and was brave to wear shorts in that weather. At his point we met each otherm they blushed to red, said hello. I said: hello boys, I never wear tights, you want to check and showed my bare legs to them. They couldn't say a word :) It was very funny.
I have some stories about people's reaction to naked legs in winter!</p>

<p>Thanks Very cold, it was nice from you.
I'm from Eastern Europe, a country neighbouring Austria but I wouldn't like to be more precise. I will keep you up to date when cold weather comes and I'll get all the attention that my bare legs and arms deserve! Now it's still over 10 C so some people stare at me but comments are rare.
There is one story that is very kind to me: when I was 20 I used to live with a woman (I'm bi). She lived on a hill. One day in February I was in town. I needed a bus to get to home (her place). But it snowed so heavily that the bus was cancelled. It was also cold. I wore a sweater and leather shorts. The shorts stopped just below my bottom. I had a pair of open sandals too! And of course I didn't wear anything to cover my legs. I started to walk up the hill with 2 girls who also needed the same bus. It was good exercise upwards but I was still shivering. They were sisters and kept asking if I was cold and why I was dressed like that. I explained that it was my usual outfit. In a covered bus stop we sat on the bench to take a rest and they saw the goosebumps on my shivering naked legs. So they started to rub and massage it. One took her gloves off, the other one kept her wool gloves on. It was so good as they massaged my bare legs. They didn't even stop at the top of my thighs ...
When they saw that I enjoyed it they invited to their place which was closer than my friend's. We had a really good time - you can imagine what we were doing :)
I even met them later 2 times but then they moved to Germany.</p>

<p>How do you normally recover when you return indoors after a tough day in the cold? </p>

<p>Say that even you are covered in goose bumps, your hands are numb, legs are red and you are simply quite happy to get home! Do you have any tricks like drinking something warm, hot shower? A big wool blanket would be cheating, right?</p>

<p>Thanks Lorna for the details!</p>

<p>Today I had a long 3 hour walk with the dog near the sea where I live. Temperature here is +5C, wind was quite strong and it was drizzling a little. I wonder how you would have dressed for this adventure. Short shorts of course, sleeveless top with bare back and shoulders? </p>

<p>Wind was really annoying and every piece of clothes got wet. Even the dog was shivering a little.  Would you have minded sitting down on the rocks for a while and enjoy the scents in the damp air? Do you think you would have been able to ignore the harsh conditions and just let your beautiful bare arms and legs be on display?</p>

<p>Gbf: nice idea! I'd go for the short shorts for sure with bare legs of course. Maybe short leather shorts. I think I'd dare the bare arms too but with a gillet under my t-shirt, so no for bare back. I wouldn't like to get a pneumonia.
I think after a walk I'd sit on the rock for 15-20 min. Maybe someone would rub and massage my naked legs :)
I walked a lot todat as well. It was 12 C where I live so no real excitement for me. Most people are more covered than myself, I wore today my shortest shorts (showing some bottom) and a sleeveless top. I saw 2 other girls bare legged. One had a mini skirt, the other one shorts that went down to her knees. Although it's quite mild they were the only ones with bare legs (other than myself).</p>

<p>Lorna you're really amazing. Please share other stories with us. Could you recall how strangers commented your unusual outfit and the fact that your cute legs and arms were unprotected in harsh conditions? Does if often happen that people get to touch your naked parts? Do you work or study?</p>

<p>Very good that you care about your health, it makes the whole scenario even more attractive! </p>

<p>Gilet and covered shoulders is a good idea and maybe we can wish for a T-shirt with very short sleeves so that any goose bumps on your upper arms do not risk appearing under any concealing piece of fabric! </p>

My experience is that if you cover up your breast and stomach you are not getting a cold even if your arms and legs are naked. I wear warm panties in winter time too and leather shorts which are also warmer so even when my legs are completely bare including all my thighs, my private parts are not cold.</p>

<p>I always try to convince my partners to go for skimpy clothes. For men I wouldn't recommend bare midriff or back :) But they should wear shorts much more than they do. And I think men should also wear shorts that are shorter than those terrible bermudas. Once I had a boyfriend and I managed to convince him to wear shorts even in wintertime. Unfortunately by the time I succeeded he fell in love with an other woman.
I've never dated any girl who was so resistant to cold as myself. But I really like to hang out with an other girl in the cold and touching our bare legs and arms.
Now I am in the search as I don't have a partner :(</p>

<p>For me, a man wearing shorts in winter is completely uninteresting. A girl in skimpy outfit together with a man fully dressed for winter is a nicer sight than if he was wearing thin clothes! Two girls in skimpy dresses in cold conditions are even more interesting than one, if possible! </p>

<p>There are things called "racerbacks" for men (gym shirts) which are like tank tops, but with the shoulder blade area showing.  Those look cool.  They don't keep you warm much at all, and you show off half your back, and shops that don't like shirtless people let you in.</p>

<p>It seems nowadays more and more men are going for shorts and a jumper instead of jeans and a tshirt (i.e. baring their legs in preference to their arms), not sure why.  I even saw one today in proper short shorts and a jacket.</p>

<p>Hi Lorna. You're right, you only need to keep your body core warm, doesn't matter about your arms and legs. Let them enjoy the fresh cold air. Try a cold shower first thing in the morning. That'll make it feel warmer for a few minutes afterwards, just enough time to give you that confidence to leave that sweater at home as you leave home. Or why not give your sweater away now while it's still mild? Leave it behind a friend's sofa or take it to a charity shop.</p>

<p>And who was it who said winter swimmers put warm clothes on when they get out of the water? I run home in vest and shorts and bare feet. I only wear flip-flops if it's icy too avoid cutting my feet. I don't even get dry as I don't take a towel.</p>

<p>Wildswimmer: Actually, I find it's better NOT to keep your core warm.  If your core is covered and your hands and feet are bare, you get numb fingers/toes as your blood is moved away from them, as they're the coldest part of you.  If all of you is equally cold, you don't get numb bits, you just shiver (which I enjoy).</p>

<p>Wildswimmer: I run to a lake (1.5 hour run over grassy mountains), swim for a couple of hours (any time of year), then run back.  I only wear speedos for the running, and nothing for the swimming.  I love running back as my upper body shivers like mad.</p>

<p>Lorna, I have yet another question to you, if you don t mind! </p>

<p>Have you tried different skimpy outfit styles and figured out if people react differently?</p>

<p>Your standard clothing is short shorts and a tiny top, right? Do you think you would get different reactions if you were dressed in a sweet mid thigh length summer dress with short sleeves, on a cold and nasty day? 
The two clothing styles give very different signals: The first style is a little on the extreme side and hot, while the other is just feminine, soft and tender but in a completely unusual context!</p>

<p>I believe that both examples are equally challenging with regard to cold tolerance! </p>

<p>Hope you had a great week so far! </p>

<p>Well, Lorna, now you have three ideas for those really cold days. Please try out all three and let us know which you feel most comfortable in, or which make you suffer the most, anyway whichever you prefer, and let us know.

<p>Yes, clean enough to drink (which I do while swimming).  It's a reservoir up a mountain.  I have a more local river, but like yours I wouldn't swim in it.  The shore is thick deep mud, and I'd look a little silly running back to my house absolutely caked in it.  It's also near a landfill site, so it's probably not just mud.</p>

<p>@gbf: When I was younger I wore 50% shorts and 50% mini skirts. Dresses have never been my style, I wear them very rarely. Don't know why, just don't like them. As I grew older (now early 30s) I tend to wear my shorts like 70% of the time and 30% skirt. I can't see any difference in people's reaction but I'll keep an eye on it this winter!
Finally the weather is getting colder where I live :) Just checked the forecast: it'll be around 5C max daytime! That's already an attention caller to my bare legs :)</p>

<p>Lorna, thanks for telling the details! </p>

<p>+5C is chilly for bare legs but you are of the right stuff! I think that everyone who sees you gets at least half a degree higher body temperature!  </p>

<p>For how long time are you outdoors on a normal day? </p>

<p>Do you work in an office and wear the same minimal clothes all day long?  </p>

<p>Judging from the comments you get sometimes, do you think most people enjoy the fact that you can stand the cold, or do they just enjoy a skimpy dressed girl like always?   </p>

<p>If I only go to work and back home, I am not too long outdoors. Maybe all totgether 1 hour (we go out for lunch with my coworkers). But often I go to walk in the city or to shop after work or meet friends etc.
I work in a small office, 15 staff all together. They know me by now and accept my outfit, it's not a big bank with dress code, more like a family.
So I work in my shorts or skirt with bare legs. Today I came in a black mini skirt, not to be in shorts all the time :)</p>

<p>@lorna: bare legs are always welcome, even in a bank! </p>

<p>Today was a fantastic late autumn day up here in the Nordic countries. Just above 0C but the puddles on the fields were frozen. Sunny, no wind and clear air. 
How would you have dressed if you were going out for a walk for a couple of hours? Would the sun warm you enough to have bare arms? 
Maybe a short sleeved polo shirt to warm your neck a little bit?</p>

<p>What do you think is the lowest temperature you could live in 24/7 and only be dressed minimally? 
It is tough to never recover in normal room temperature, but maybe something that is possible to get used to. 
What could be realistic, +12C?</p>

<p>The girl at the pizza place I visited this evening to pick up our take-away pizzas was wearing a thin short sleeved shirt, the corporate uniform. It was 4C outside and there was a strong draught blowing in through the wide open door. Her arms were covered in goosebumps. As she took my order her hand was shaking so violently she could hardly write. She kept smiling at me when she spoke. Her male colleagues all wore long sleeved shirts under the short sleeved uniform but she didn't. Very occasionally she went back where it was warmer but soon came back to stand in the cold draught to take more orders. After ten enjoyable minutes my pizzas were ready. She handed them to me, the warm boxes perhaps offering a brief relief from the cold, and smiled and wished me a pleasant evening. I wished her one too, hoping it would be as cold as the last ten minutes. She must have known how cold it would be. Perhaps she was enjoying her shivering shift. I, also in short sleeves, walked out into the cold night air to the car to drive home.</p>

<p>Last night as we started to watch a movie she went up stairs and changed into a little nighty.  We keep our house pretty chilly to save on heating cost.  So as we sat on the couch she was covered in goosebumps.  She really hates being cold but will suffer through it for special nights.  We dont smoke in the house so we had to go out in the freezing cold to smoke.  The night air had to be in the teens i was cold all bundled up and she just wore her nighty and a light hoodie.  Every smoke we had she shivered more and her goosebumps got bigger.  As we layed on the couch i massaged her lovely goosebumped legs which sent more chills through her body. After the movie we went out for a last smoke before heading upstairs.  She left her hoddy in the house i massaged her shivering arms as she sat on the cold concrete.  As we went upstairs she had 1 finally treat for the night,  she grabbed a bowl full of ice for a lovely ice massage.  Rubbing a beautiful shivering goosebumped woman with ice cube after ice cube is a sexy sight.  Near the end she was shivering so bad.  We had fun as i warmed her back up. ;)</p>

<p>Few days ago we were at house-party (we live in the Middle Europa). It was really cold then (around 5C) and was also raining all the day. Everyone was dressed in long jeans and long-sleeve blouses, pullovers and sth like this. At the beginning however a couple came, he was dressed like others, but his girlfriend wore mini-skirt,  high boots (just below knee) and tank top, which was even unable to cover her belly when her arms were up (she took off the jacket). She had no thights, her legs were totally bare, even despite it was so cold outside and they come by bus. </p>

<p>She didn't seem to feel any cold, just was sitting with others and having fun, but seemed that other haven't notice she didn't has thights. Only when her boyfriend caught her in full-nelson and some of ger friends started to tickle her underarms and belly, one of them tickled her thigh and shouted "hey, you don't have tights!".</p>

<p>After some drinking we went to the club, still by bus. In meantime it started to snowing. We were all fully clothed, while she had to face it with her bare legs, but she didn't have any problem with it. When we were coming back from the club, there was enough snow for making snowballs and obviously her legs were main goal, especialy as her boyfriend had to come back earlier and two of the guys were holding her hand while we tried to hit her legs or belly.</p>

<p>@volantia: That was a nice story about a brave lady! Hope she got beautiful goose bumps after the snow ball treatment and that she kept her wet and skimpy clothes afterwards, with a smile on her lips!</p>

<p>It is always nice to see girls braving the cold and how they struggle to ignore that they are freezing. At the supermarket the other day, I was lucky to see a nice looking girl at checkout who seriously regretted her choice of uniform that day. She wore a blouse with very short, folded sleeves and her checkout desk was located close to the entrance of the megastore. </p>

<p>It was quite cold even for us customers with winter coats and I could see that her arms were covered in goose bumps. Every time there was a short break in her work with scanning the goods, she tried to warm her upper arms with her hands. She tried to move her hands so that it looked as if she naturally happened to touch her arms, but result was that she really signaled that she was freezing badly! </p>

<p>That employee would deserve double salary for that performance!     </p>

<p>Today, round midnight, it is prime time for all goose bumps to show up on all bare arms and legs that hopefully are suffering in the harsh winter night while we watch the fireworks! We wish them good luck!    </p>

<p>@gbf: Thank you for your nice story and for your kind comments on mine. Maybe your checkout girl (and mine) didn't regret their choice of clothing at all. Maybe they deliberately chose those clothes knowing full well how cold it would be. Maybe they enjoyed their shivering and suffering? That's what it's all about isn't it - choosing up front your clothes and then going into the cold. Maybe it's sometimes far colder than you thought it was going to be. Can I "bare" it? A while ago I chose never to wear long sleeves again. The last time I tried my partner asked me what was wrong with me: "But you never wear long sleeves!" Even though it was freezing and snowing...</p>

<p>Just to give you some feedback: <b>I love your stories!!!</b></p>

<p>They are amongst the very best in this thread. I also loved the ones from coalburner (who sadly seems to have disappeared) and laloli (who also disappeared). I love the rather lengthy stories with build-up and some evolution of the situation. </p>

<p>Last week I was for a day in NYC (work trip). It was a freezing day, slightly below 0C with some snow and a heavy wind blowing. </p>

<p>Everybody totally wrapped up ... but I saw one girl at 32nd and 8th - pretty cute, nice legs, around 20 I think, happily walking around in short shorts, no tights and a T-shirt. Lovely! </p>

<p>Sadly I was with people from a company we work with and I couldn't follow her to take photos :(</p>

The skirt for example, did she argue, did you have to convince her to take it off? What about laying in the snow? was it a struggle to get her to do?</p>

<p>Well I still think getting her in the snow in something wet would be beautiful. Denim short shorts and a blouse perhaps? Or a slinky $%!@tail dress?</p>

<p>Other things could maybe be a snowball fight, or sunbathing in a swimsuit, in the snow of course. Perhaps she could spend a few minutes crawling in it as well?</p>

<p>There is one other thing, but it might be something she has to build up to. A snow shower. Dress her in a swimsuit, or some underwear if she likes, hell she could do it fully clothed if she really wanted. fill some buckets with powder-y snow and tip them over her one by one, she'll have to wash with that snow, soap up and use the melting water to rinse off. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Oh do tell us how she reacts when you tell her those ideas for the first time. </p>

<p>I'd be interested to hear what everyone else thinks of them too. Do any of our girls think they could withstand them? Perhaps someone has a similar story to share?</p>

<p><i>cool!</i></p>

<p>You (and her, of course) are getting better and better!
Love the idea with the leash and still more this "bottomless" outfit!</p>

<p>The best thing, however, is that she didn't insist on hiding her face. A blurred face destroys even the sexiest pic. </p>

<p>Hello everyone! It's nice to be back after so long!</p>

<p>@shiverfan thank you so much for those wonderful pictures! Your model was absolutely stunning, she had a gorgeous face, and a gorgeous body! I couldn't believe though that I couldn't really see any goosebumps though, she must really be tough! :)</p>

<p>Since I haven't contributed in a while, I do have a story I'd like to share that happened a few days ago.....if that's ok of course! ;)</p>

<p>I have a close friend that I live with who is a beautiful, very sexy young lady, and everybody knows it. She's about 5'7", long flowing brown hair, gorgeous eyes, and a fantastic rack with excellent legs. But she also has no cold tolerance whatsoever which is always a plus! A few nights ago we were out and about and it was nice out for once. I'm from the Northern United States so it's usually really cold, but it was about 50F which was very surprising. She wore a light black cardigan and a sleeveless sundress underneath since it was sunny earlier and compared to what we had been having, was unseasonably warm even for her. As we walked around and did our thing, the temperature started dropping significantly. I could see goosebumps on her bare legs all through the evening but she didn't complain or anything other than the occasional "I'm cold." </p>

<p>We went to dinner around 8pm and when we came out of the restaurant around 9 the temperature had dropped to about 25F and got very windy. The moment we stepped out, she shrieked and a massive shiver overtook her body. She crossed her arms tightly in front of her trying to get warm and the goosebumps on her legs got even bigger. Her teeth started chattering and I could see her body shaking uncontrollably as we tried to walk but it was getting hard for her to even do that. I wasn't wearing a whole lot myself but cold doesn't bother me much so I offered her my jacket. She refused it though saying through chattering teeth that "I was the idiot that decided to wear this outfit, so I should have to deal with it!" </p>

<p>Because she was so stiff from shivering and the cold, walking was difficult and she was already to begin with.......not the most coordinated person. We had just gotten a foot of snow a couple weeks ago and because it got drastically warmer it mostly melted, creating a lot of big puddles and melting snowdrifts. But since it cooled down below freezing that night for the first time in a few days, some of it froze making it very slippery. As she tried to walk, she slipped and slid feet first right into a huge puddle. She was fine, but she was soaked to the bone. I pulled her up and she was dripping wet all over. Because she was wet her shivering was even more intense, her teeth were chattering even harder. She took off her cardigan because that was the most wet and she knew that even though her arms would be bare, it would be better than wet clothing chilling her skin. But since she was wearing a sleeveless dress, all of her arms were exposed. I kept her as close to me as I could the entire walk back to our apartment, her arms were covered in huge goosebumps, and the shivering never ceased.</p>

<p>When we finally got back to our apartment around 10:30pm it took her hours to warm up. Her teeth chattered for about an hour, and her body stopped shaking around midnight. I'm not sure if the goosebumps ever went away. Basically I spent the night keeping her warm, as she did have mild hypothermia. It was definitely a most memorable evening! :)</p>

<p>Sorry I'm kind of long winded, but that's my story and yes this did happen a few nights ago! I hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Hello all!  Someone suggested I come her and relate my experiences.  I am an exhibitionist and slave to my husband.  We live in the Dallas, TX, USA area where in winter it can be balmy one day and freezing the next.  I live under clothing restrictions. No female is allowed to be dressed at any time inside our home.  This includes me and our 4-year-old daughter.  We also have a 6-year-old son who is allowed to undress at home as he pleases but is not under any restrictions.  </p>

<p>When away from home, I live with the understanding that being clothed is a privilege.  Anyone at any time may ask for part or all of my clothing and I must give it to them.  I am allowed to dress as I like for the elements, but often I end up totally naked in winter.  My husband takes me to strip once a month on amateur night and I have to give up my clothes to the audience and go home naked.  In cold weather I am allowed a blanket in the car but not to walk to or from the car.  This is good for me as it builds up my resistance and immune systems and reminds me that my purpose in life is to serve others.  My personal comfort is not important if the way the cold forces my nipples "to attention" is pleasing to others.  </p>

<p>I found one of these rare pics of a model with goosebumps during a studio photo session!
Light settings is perfect in a studio and the pics could be really sharp.</p>

<p>I wonder why Simona (the name of the model) got such beautiful goose bumps. Did she prepare for it, did the photographer lure her into it, or did it just happen?</p>

<p>Maybe Simona knows exactly what she wants and the conversation could have been:</p>

<p>Photographer calls her and says:</p>

<p>-Hi Simona, do you want to pose nude on a purple floor in the studio later this week?</p>

<p>-Yes, sounds interesting, and please make the studio really cold so I can show off huge goose bumps and rock hard nipples, as usual! I got high ratings, last time we made such pics! </p>

<p>-No problem, I let the windows open during the night so studio will be really chilly for you!</p>

<p>-Thanks, I will prepare as usual, cold showers, abs workout and freezing all day long to burn maximum body fat!      </p>

<p>-Nice, see you then!</p>

<p>Absolutely, I love these pictures!! I'm surprised you can't really see the goosebumps on a lot of them, she must be extremely cold. I'm curious, when you took these pictures, was she shivering controllably? She looks very relaxed and not at all bothered by the cold, but she might be a really good actress. Thank you for sharing!</p>

<p>She is so beautiful! And she has an amazing body, and shows it off really well! I just love her smile. How cold was she during this photoshoot? I can't really see goosebumps too well but I'm assuming they're there. Were her teeth chattering, or was she shivering really hard? She is stunning!</p>

<p>they are all great, she's very brave, as for me the best are those where she's doing something natural instead for posing, like snow-angel or drawing heart on the snow; maybe it's an idea to make some shots by doing physical excersises (stretching, hanging from the tree-bunch) or something like this</p>

<p>All of your shots thus far are fantastic. She's really standing up to this well. You can tell how cold she's getting from the lovely shade of purple her legs and backside are going, very nice indeed. Just a couple of other comments, maybe a few shots where she looks a touch less professional and we can really tell how much she's freezing. I like the idea of a little exercise mentioned above too. Finally I still dream of the day you can convince her to go for a swim, or damped her down in some way. There's nothing better than cold wet clothes clinging to a freezing female body.</p>

<p>I've lurked on this site for a while and although I appreciate how the long-term exposure to cold can be a turn-on I am much more interested in the short and shocking contrast between hot and cold! For example I went for an early-morning run two days ago. It was sunny but cold and I wore only shorts and a t-shirt (plus trainers). I was a little short of time so I pushed myself around the 4 mile course and was pretty hot and sweaty when I got home, despite the cold air temperature. When I got in I had very little time to shower and change for work. I put the shower on its coldest setting and stripped off on the balcony to let my running stuff dry. I then got straight under the cold shower and washed thoroughly - I like to use a really tingly mint shower gel and scrub with a body brush all over. By the time I had finished I really felt amazing - hot and cold at the same time and incredibly turned on, though I denied myself a climax! I really felt incredibly fresh and invigorated for the rest of the day. I would really love to hear from others (particularly women) who share this kind of enjoyment of very intense "good for you" sensuality and I could write some stories in this theme if of interest.</p>

<p>Hi </p>

<p>Found some quite nice pics of a lovely girl covered in goose bumps after an outdoor shower. Her name is Yanna and is a model at hegre-art.com. Her tanned skin gives perfect contrast for sharp goose bumps photos and her skinny body is a delight to watch.  </p>

<p>Thanks coldness13, these photos are great!</p>

<p>That girl has the spirit! She is ready to suffer a lot to get good photos. Her willingness to show off is stronger than the pain she feels. She also has the perfect body for goosebump-photos; tanned and athletic build.  </p>

<p>Any chance there is more of her? </p>

<p>I'm glad you like the photos.  I'm afraid that they are the only ones I know about from that photoshoot.  As it was, they were not easy to find -- the entire site is in Russian, which I don't read. </p>

<p>I was pretty amazed (as well as delighted) by these shots also.  I know Russian girls can be pretty tough when it comes to cold tolerance, but I still can't imagine how she was able to dunk herself in ice water so casually like that!</p>

<p>Yes, her casualness is the big thing here. She has trained herself to ignore the pain from the ice water so she can look relaxed and attractive. </p>

<p>Here is another lady that is doing a good job. Showing off in a summer dress is more important than that she is freezing.</p>

<p>Pain?  I've never found cold painful.  It's just a temperature.  A lot of hot or a lot of cold and your muscles don't work so well, but neither is painful.</p>

<p>Hey guys, so over a year ago, I remember being on this forum. Basically, I had been roleplaying as my friend (I hope some of you would forgive me). My friend (well call her Kim which is her last name to make it easier while she remains anonymous) and I used to go to college together and I would always envy her skinny body and her ability to go bare legs every day despite the cold weather. In a way, I always wanted to be her and thats why I was roleplaying online :(</p>

<p>In case you want to know who I am, I am a 23-year-old Thai girl living in the US. During my freshmen year of college, I joined a sorority where I met Kim and back then, she was already going bare legs and often bare arms outside in the winter. We were roommates and I noticed that her closet only had short shorts and miniskirts and tank tops and loose sweaters but absolutely nothing that could cover up her thighs or any form of jacket. So naturally, I was very curious how she does it so I started asking her and she told me A LOT of stories because she was obviously very proud of her body and ability :) In fact, most of the stuff you guys ask me here, I go ask Kim and she tells me stories and I kinda write them out while envying her haha. She was really a very brave girl, she barely got sick despite wearing short shorts and tank tops the entire winter and even when she was sick, she dressed the same just to look sexy and please her bf... I wish I could do that.</p>

<p>Anyways, I started getting very intrigued by her stories and kind of envious of her and I actually told her this so she started training me, within a few months, I lost 15 pounds of weight from 135 pounds to 120 (61 kg to 53 kg) through exercising with her and following her diet. However, once I hit 120 pounds, I had a hard time going down further to her weight, which is 110, so I was still not nearly as skinny as her (plus, she is 5'9 while I am 5'6). So unfortunately, my BMI never made it to the underweight category although I got really close. She also trained me in wearing less during the winter but that didnt work out too well since I have such low endurance to the cold I could start shivering in stores during the summer from the AC :( Anyways, she made me wear one of her short shorts and go bare legs with her on a cold winter night when it was about 20F out. I opened the door and started shivering instantly while she didnt shiver until a minute after and she was wearing a paper thin tank top as well while I actually had a jacket on so it was just my legs that were exposed. I felt very sexy that night and we had an emotional girl talk at a park but she could tell I was shivering uncontrollably and chattering teeth a lot more than her despite being dressed more and after about 20 minutes, I wasnt able to walk straight anymore and I felt like I had a huge headache. So I asked Kim to go back but while we were walking back, she kinda had to drag me because I had hypothermia by this point. She had a hard time dragging me because she is so thin and was shivering a lot herself as well! So she called her boyfriend to come help out but it took him a while to come so I was already pretty sick by then. We made it back to the apartment somehow and her boyfriend helped out with me but I still ended up going to a doctor in the morning who yelled at me for not dressing well.</p>

<p>From this experience, I realized trying to go bare legs in the winter like Kim was a bad idea but I often dreamed about being able to show off like her. Unfortunately, my family is from Thailand where the average temperature is like 85F/30C and anything below 75F/24C is considered cold. In case you didnt know, Thailand is very close to the equator so I mustve gotten genes that were terrible at baring the cold. Also, I noticed that most of the people in this thread are from northern Europe such as Germany, Austria, and UK so that is consistent with my belief. Now dont get me wrong, I love my country and my people but I just wished I had better genes for this. Also, during my senior year when Kim became the VP of our sorority chapter, she started this new competition where all the girls had to stand outside on a cold winter night in our sorority tank tops and short shorts for an hour. I remember I surrendered in about 10 minutes because it got unbearably cold for me. And there were 2 girls that went could barely made it past 2 minutes, this Egyptian girl and a this girl from Singapore because they have even worse genes than me for braving the cold. Only Kim and this half Russian half Siberian girl made it through the whole hour and there was this German girl who got real close.</p>

<p>Anyways, sorry for the long post and for posting a picture from the web back then (it was actually from a Thai site haha). I think someone messaged me asking for a pic of me (or in reality, Kim) so I asked her if I can take a pic of her to share with people on the internet and she firmly said no. But I didnt want to be a let down so I tried to improvise rather than reveal I am writing in place of my friend. Shes currently working in Seoul now at a luxury fashion store but she came back to the states to visit her friends like me during Thanksgiving (which she allowed me to take a few pics of her here without her face) and just yesterday for July 4 and that was when I remembered this site.  </p>

<p>In case you guys wanna know what shes up to, she still hasnt worn anything that covers her legs since then but she hasnt been wearing tank tops in the winter unfortunately since that is viewed negatively and not acceptable at her job in Korea. She said she enjoys the states better because there are actually a good amount of girls wearing short shorts and mini skirts in the winter in Seoul so she doesnt stand out as much haha</p>

<p>Thanks Coldness13 for posting the video with the models in ice sculpture house! Great performance, but I am curious if the still photos that were taken maybe caught some goose bumps!</p>

<p>I was lucky the other day to see few ladies freezing during a sightseeing boat trip in the archipelago. The boat cruised for four hours and during the trip the air temperature dropped from 25C to 12C. All seats were outdoors on deck and some young ladies were dressed in short shorts and crop tops, expecting a warm and cozy evening on a sunny boat deck. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, but good for me, they were severely mistaken! When the sun set and the night breeze started to blow they suffered badly in the cold. They tried to huddle in their seats and did not brave the cold at all. The cold made weak creatures of the $%!@y beauties! Unfortunately, they were offered blankets from the deck assistant after too short time of suffering! </p>

<p>A true summer girl does not let us down so easily. She gladly wears minimal clothes despite a cold summer night because all admiring glances from people around compensate any discomfort from the cold.  Wouldn t it be nice to see a "summer girl challenge" where the challenge is to look attractive and relaxed despite chilly weather in summer. The candidates should wear a minimal summer dress and sit on a terrace during a cold, windy and humid evening that we often have here in north Scandinavia. They must ignore that they are freezing so no attempt to huddle is allowed. The wind shall tantalize their bodies and challenge their mind. A candidate starting to look annoyed goes out.  Neither shivering bodies, nor chattering teeth are allowed. These are signs the candidate is no longer in control of the situation, which a true summer girl always is.  I would love to see the goose bumps and all attempts to discreetly turn their bodies in the chair trying to alleviate the discomfort from the agonizing cold air biting their skin! </p>

<p>Those who like to see shivering girls, I suggest that the candidates having to leave the challenge because of shivering should continue in a different group where the mission is to stand the cold as long as possible no matter how the body reacts!</p>

<p>Will probably take some time until that is an Olympic discipline!</p>

<p>I would be willing to pay anywhere from 10-15 for a 10 minute video if it had alot of visible and audible teeth chattering. If anybody has heard of chillygirls.com, that is what they don't have is alot of teeth chattering. This fetish some of us have is a rare one and difficult to find.</p>

<p>I would also pay, but I have often downloaded and payed for videos wich promised shivering content. And mostly, if it's a 10 min. video, the women in the shoot had just started shivering, when the video ended. Often it was like that with chillygirls videos. So, if you have a video with only 10 min., you should really start filming when she is already shivering visibly, wich can be 30 min. into the experience if you're not so lucky to find someone who shivers hard right from the start. Those are very rare. But, to make a long story short, if she shivers, I will pay. </p>

<p>the trembling lips can easily be faked (I am not saying that she did). on chillygirls you find videos of girls really shivering, Mimosa and Crystall are the best ones, for chattering teeth Anja). </p>

<p>I personally wouldn't want my girl to freeze just to look beautiful. It's crazy what girls do just to look nice. I want my girl to dress warmly during the cold periods of the year but if she wants to dress up to look beautiful, then she can go ahead if she insists.  </p>

<p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>Some of you may know me from the Shivergoosebump Yahoo group and/or from my youtube channel where I post videos of myself shivering.  I am a young man, however, so that type of shivering isn't what everybody is looking for.  </p>

<p>I just read through  most of the thread and really appreciate all the links to photos and videos and so on.  I will continue reading but I was too excited to finally find this thread that I had to respond. </p>

<p>At the bottom of this message, I will link to my youtube channel if anybody wants to check it out.  All of my videos show me shivering heavily, but like I said I am a young man and I am baring a lot of skin, so it may not be for everybody.  I will have to check and make sure my "Cold" playlist is public on youtube so that everybody can check out all the videos I've compiled throughout the years of shivering and cold women.  I will also like to my Flickr page where there are some photos of me covered in goosebumps, but I also have photos of girls with goosebumps I've taken in public, plus some sexy photos of friends and my additionally my aunt, who I can't help but become aroused by as she is a violently sexy middle aged woman. </p>

<p>I have 3 stories which I have written that are based on real life that feature cold / shivering girls.  They are in MS Word format and I'm not sure the best way to post those here.  </p>

<p>I've found a ton of great shivering videos on Clips4Sale, but I've had to root through and waste a ton of money on bad videos as well. I can provide links and so forth for those videos for interested parties.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post, just wanted to introduce myself and share what I have available. I've been turned on by goosebumps and by watching girls struggle with the cold for as long as I can remember and it's nice to finally meet some others who share the same feelings.</p>

<p>Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4lJptVoYoXZNe9fyH_tRkQ/videos</p>

<p>Welcome to the group, James. Thanks for the playlist. Yes, I'm afraid I only get turned on by women being cold, especially if they enjoy it - or myself of course, but not other men. It's great to know though that other men feel like I do. Makes me feel less of a weirdo. Where do you live? I'm in the UK. Like you I've felt like this since I was very young (less than five). I've never met a woman who feels the same way and all those in this group, except for Joyce, seem too good to be true or have turned out to be fakes. Shiverfan's Elizabeth was the best by far  - unfortunately he deleted lots of her stories when he got a new girlfriend but she's coming along slowly too. I'd like to hear your stories.</p>

<p>Thanks James for the posts! </p>

<p>The car exhibition hostess is roar stylish in her classy dress and arms covered in goose bumps.  Very vigilant of you to catch them on photo! That is actually my favourite scene: an attractive lady suffering in the cold, baring her skin on arms and legs to please other people in an official situation!   </p>

<p>I like to see her mastering her discomfort from freezing, because her job is to be the eye catcher for other people. That is real elegant professionalism.</p>

<p>I'm a sixteen year old girl, and when I go out with my parents, I always have to have bare legs.  No exceptions no matter how cold it is.  Sometimes my legs are blue and really goosy. Some times they make me wear shorts which means my thighs are cold and exposed     My parents won't explain why they do this which is really annoying. If I keep asking about closed subjects, I get punished.  I think they think tights or stockings are tarty, but my mum wears them.  </p>

<p>Here's a handful of my favorites from Clips4Sale:</p>

<p>3 good ones from The Leather Princess 
Main Store: http://clips4sale.com/studio/58767/The-Leather-Princess 
In the search box, type "Cold" and the following 3 clips are worthwhile:
"Cold and Wet Feet"  (Huge goosebumps, discomfort, minor shivering)
"Very Cold, Very Wet" (Huge goosebumps, severe discomfort, chattering teeth, shivering)
"Leather Babe in Cold Weather"  (Severe discomfort, chattering teeth, shivering)</p>

<p>Quite a few from Dunk Tank Girls Video Clip Store
Main Store: http://clips4sale.com/studio/10180/DUNK-TANK-GIRLS--VIDEO-CLIP-STORE
In the search box, type "Tara" and download the following:
"Tara's Bikini Dunking Part 1 and Tara's Bikini Dunking Part 2" (Extreme discomfort, shivering, and chattering teeth if you watch closely.  These 2 are my favorites)
In the search box, type "Vanessa" and download "Vanessa Dunked in her Bikini" (Severe discomfort, chattering teeth, and shivering)
In the search box, type "Trisha." It's a good bet that any of Trisha's videos will have her shivering with extreme discomfort.  </p>

<p>This is a good start for now.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know about Galina Kutereva - a woman who does not feel the cold?</p>

<p>Here is some info about her: </p>

<p>http://bashny.net/t/en/161533</p>

<p>And a video for those who know russian: </p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsvt5qIcDE</p>

<p>She is really amazing and violently attractive. But is it really true? Can her body actually produce so much heat that she can keep fingers and toes warm?</p>

<p>She would be very good at winterswimming then....!</p>

<p>Here is a more normal girl who is so cute in the ice hole. She continues to swim and swim, and when she finally leaves the water she doesn't even dry herself before starting a jogging trip! </p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ld1iLHldk</p>

<p>That is the spirit! </p>

<p>I'm still here. It's still warm here. Had a trip to the US again recently. I love the fact that the aircon is so cold over there. The best is when women wear their sleeveless summer dresses and get goosebumps. The worst is when the cardigan comes out to cover up the beautiful tanned arms.</p>

<p>It's starting to cool off here.  The only problem is, it being a small town, everyone is sensible even when at the bar.  I'd like to collect some ice skating stories, but that's gonna take effort and time.</p>

<p>I wonder if women actually do not realize how attractive they are if they show off bare arms and legs even when they are freezing.   </p>

<p>Most women sacrifice a great deal to appear attractive in other situations; they wear uncomfortable shoes, tight jeans, etc. but just the slightest cold wind makes them put on clothes.</p>

<p>Or is the problem that most men do not care if they see goose bumps or cardigan fabric?</p>

<p>The thought process could be as simple as "shivering isn't sexy".  Let's just chalk it up as one of Life's Great Mysteries.</p>

<p>My wife hates being cold but I can't stop myself getting horny when she is covered in goosebumps the look and feel of her skin drive me nuts!!!
There is nothing better than seeing her goosebumps under sheer hold ups, watching the goosebumps forming under the nylon.
The sight of her goosebumps on her arms and chattering teeth WOW but she insists that she hates being cold and can't understand why I find it such a massive turn on</p>

<p>Probably most women do not like to be cold, but at least some women should be willing to endure the discomfort of freezing, if they knew that some men found them attractive in that shape. </p>

<p>Maybe Divemaster is right: women do not understand that a freezing body is a turn on for some men. </p>

<p>Most women know that men like to see bare arm and legs and it is really a mystery if they think  goose bumps on their skin and a shivering body whould make them less attractive.      </p>

<p>So, I got bored and decided to make use of clips4sale's universal search.  Did a keyword search for "shivering" and surprisingly got 75 pages of results.  Here's some of the more appealing ones I found.  I haven't actually bought and downloaded any (No job anymore) so view at your own discretion.</p>

<p>Omg I can't believe i actually found this topic. I literally searched for ages on the internet to find other women who wear minimal clothing all year long and  men who really appreciate that!</p>

<p>So first of all Hey. I'm Julia(call me July), 19 years of age and yeah I wear minimal clothing almost everyday and every temperature. 
I'm from Hamburg in Germany(so sorry for any grammar mistakes or confusing sentence construction. English is not my native language) 
and in Germany I almost never see anyone showing much skin when it gets cold.</p>

<p>So I'm wearing minimal clothing in freezing temperatures now since 3 years because back in the days I wanted to look sexy and attract boys. Then I started to like having goosebumps all over my skin, getting a blue-ish skin color and just started to get kinda comfortable with shivering my $%!@ of.^^ </p>

<p>So now I mainly wear minimal clothing, because I like the ice-cold feeling on my skin, but ofc because the boys love it, too. :D </p>

<p>Minimal clothing for me is a jeans hotpants most of the time and a sleeveless tank top. I also love to wear croptops which show of my bare midriff. 
Miniskirts and short dresses are fine as well, but I rarely wear them. </p>

<p>I could write a TON of very cold experiences if you want me to do.
But dont expect any photos or videos of me. I dont wanna have footage of my body on the internet. Hope you understand that. c:</p>

<p>I'm so incredibly happy I found this page and read all these amazing stories.
XO July</p>

<p>Happy to see people appreciating my kinda crazy clothing style and not just insulting me being a $%!@ or telling me I'd be dumb and wouldn't pay attention to my health. :3
So if you have any questions for me, just feel free to ask them. c:
And yes of course I can tell you more:</p>

<p>Last New Year's Eve I went to a party at a friend's house. He gives a party at New Year's Eve every year, cause he has a huge house with a big garden and no neighbours we could disturb, since his house is literally in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>I wore a white, backless mini dress with quite a big cleavage and some high heels. No underwear or socks. 
To get to the party, I had to catch a train for a 30 minutes ride and then another 30 minutes walk from the train station to the location. As soon as I left the train goosebumps immediately covered my bare bodyparts. It was a freezing evening(approx. -3°C / 26°F) with some chilly wind. Since I was already late to the party I took of my heels, so I could walk faster and warm up a little. Surprisingly the asphalt was warmer than I expected for my bare feet. I arrived at the party just a little cold. It was around 10 PM and the party was great. I took some shot, drank some wine and danced a lot. Someone arranged a huge and very beautiful firework at midnight. I was a little drunk.^^ At around 3 AM most of the guest left the party and one kinda handsome guy asked me, if I'd like to spend the remaining night with him. Of course I said yes and he took me out to his expensive looking black convertible. As we both sat down he asked my where my jacket is. I answered "I don't need such things."</p>

<p>He was a little confused but he started the engine and accelerated. Soon after that I pressed the button to remove the sundeck. Now he was very confused since it got even colder(like -9°C / 16°F) and there was a icy wind coming from the sides. We then had a little chat about various things and I really started to feel the icy cold. My whole body began to shiver and my skin slowly turned into a blue-ish color. Cause i wasn't wearing any underwear, you could clearly see my breast under the very thin, white dress. After roughly 40 minutes of driving through the night he stopped at a nice looking lake, you could clearly see with the moonlight. It was so quiet there. The only thing you could hear were my chattering teeth. :D
We sat down on the sand near the lake, which was very frosty. I could feel all the cold through my dress, which was so short, it barely covered my butt. I was incredibly cold at that moment, but he was nice to me I don't wanted the togetherness to end. As we sat there and talked he really was paying attention to my frosty shaking breast, which was fine to me. I mean a woman should show her property. ;)</p>

<p>He then asked me to come to this apartment and maybe have sex together. 
I don't wanted to drive all the way to his apartment, but sex was a good idea. I mean he was handsome and it really heats up the body. So I laid down at the backsea... and yeah you know how this works. :D
After that, I asked him to drive me to the next train station. We said goodbye and I sat down waiting for the train. It was a really small station, so I was the only one there. 
After a couple of minutes I started to shiver again heavily. My goosebumps were like at maximum level and I even began to sneeze sometimes. It was 4:30 AM and the timetable said the next train comes in 10 minutes, which I was happy about cause I froze enough the last hours. After 30 minutes still no train coming. By the time passing by I really had to pee. I double checked, if there really was no train approaching and went around the corner to the grass and "sat down" to pee. And it was like a bad comedy movie. Of course a train was coming in exactly that moment. I really hurried up, but it was too late. The train driver didn't stop for me. </p>

<p>Frustrated I ran to the timetable, where I saw the next train comes in 70 minutes. I was literally really $%!@ed, since I accidentally peed on a small part of my dress. :D :D
I had to wait in this arctic cold -10°C / 14°F. And this icy wind coming from all directions. I only wore an extremely short and very thin dress. Nothing more. It was just too cold for my body. After an hour my whole body was shaking uncontrollably, my teeth were chattering so hard. My whole body, even the covered parts, was blue-ish and full with goosebumps. My limit was reached. As the train arrived 20 minutes delayed my arms and legs where almost numb. It was really challenging to walk. Man I was so frozen. 
Inside the train it felt like a sauna.^^
So yes that's it. Was an exciting New Year's Eve. And despite the freezing cold and the bad luck, i was happy with that day/night. :)</p>

<p>Story was a little long. Hope thats ok for you all. &lt;3
Btw. I realized I really like writing this stuff down. I even got some goosebumps whilst writing this message. :D</p>

<p>(Again. Sorry for any language mistakes. I do my very best.)</p>

<p>xo July</p>

<p>wow, its crazy how I came across this forum, there's almost 1000 posts of people sharing their stories :)</p>

<p>so I guess I'll share mine too - I'm Eunice and I'm in Toronto. </p>

<p>It all started when I was 15 and wore a pair of really short shorts on one warm summer day. I was a freshmen in high school and that day, I got compliments from the most popular and hot senior guy in our school about how long and thin my legs looked. I am 1.80 meters (which is really tall for an Asian girl) and I am pretty leggy (my legs are 1.1 meters long) but I had not realized wearing short shorts would make me so attractive until that day (I also got comments from many other guys and some girls as well).</p>

<p>So I decided to wear only super short shorts that summer (like 15-20 cms where it barely covers my bum) but when autumn came, I didn't want to let go of the short shorts and the attention. I persuaded my mom to let me where them for longer and as the temp continues to drop, my legs started getting colder and colder and I got a lot of goosebumps. When winter came along, my mom would not let me wear the short shorts because she said it was too cold for me but I did not want to give up. We reluctantly came to a compromise where I could wear short shorts with knee-high socks and boots (so I could still have bare thighs). It was not bad because it was still very cold and I still got goosebumps on my bare thighs because I would walk to and from school for 20-30 minutes each day in freezing weather (like -10C) and hang out outside on most days for longer. And since I was the only girl with sexy bare thighs covered in goosebumps the whole winter, I got even more attention from guys :)</p>

<p>When I moved away from college, I basically threw out or donated everything that covered more than 18 cms of my legs and all the socks and boots and instead bought a lot of high heels to make my legs look even longer. I also started dieting constantly and working out to tone my legs to make them even thinner. Throughout college, I liked to wear shirts or sweaters that were a bit longer so that they completely covered my super short shorts to make it even more sexy because I looked like I was going completely bottomless. I stopped wearing panties so literally all I had on my legs was a pair of paper-thin super short shorts. I wore this with 12=15 cm high heels even during the winter and had to do it even when I was sick since there was nothing else to wear :) Since it was a huge campus and I was outside a lot and I keep my room's temperature at around 10C, my legs were basically always covered in goosebumps and freezing cold to the touch. I had my limits tested many times (there was a day when it was -25C and I still had to go outside with completely bare legs). I got an unbelievable amount of attention from some of the hottest guys as well.</p>

<p>After college, some of my friends suggested I go into modeling but I decided against it mainly because I want at least a little bit of privacy in my life and decided to teach instead. Unfortunately, as a professor, we have some sort of stupid dress code but I always bypass it by walking into the campus with a modest skirt and then taking it off as soon as I'm out of sight. I noticed that my classes always end up being predominantly male and basically all of them have their eyes on my bare long thin legs during class and probably don't pay much attention to anything else haha</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I literally just created this account for the sake of this thread, because ever since I was 6 years old I thought there was something wrong with me for liking shivering girls. Now that I'm almost through high school,  I've found a few small fetish accounts but this thread makes me feel a whole lot more normal. I'm a boy and am not willing to share pictures or anything, as I am just attracted to when girls are shivering and chattering their teeth. I will share links when I get the chance, because I have a lot of videos in storage.</p>

<p>Welcome to the thread Cold Lover - it's called psychrocism (https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ice-ice-baby-a-beginners-guide-to-psychrocism/) - it's a mental condition that we, the followers of this thread, all experience. I won't say "suffer from" because I don't think any of us suffer - we all rather enjoy it - maybe we only suffer when it's too hot! You say you like seeing girls who are cold but do you yourself like being cold? That's how it started with me. Around age 7 I realised I liked being cold. My teachers used to ask me if I was OK when I took my jumper off to go outside at break instead of putting it on (my mother used to knit me jumpers!). For a long time in my teens I used to wear more clothes than most in fear that someone would suspect my fetish, but into my 20s and more so as I've got older I wear however little I want to (as decency allows). I also like being wet, especially being in cold water - I only ever have cold showers and love being out in the rain - and go swimming in lakes, rivers or the sea at any time of the year. but of course I love seeing women being cold, whether by choice or accident. I've never actually met any female who shares my passion and this thread seems to be mainly men who enjoy cold women, like you, too, as well as several rather unbelievable story tellers. Yes, this is the only place I've found full of amazing accounts (there were even more but the guy who posted them deleted them).</p>

<p>It's great that this thread is still alive! I was afraid that it had died. Welcome to the new members, thank you for sharing your stories and links! I actually had stopped receiving notifications and I just for grins went back to see the page and I saw that more people had posted so I am VERY glad that I did!</p>

<p>My biggest thing has been goosebumps, I love them the most, particularly if you can really see and feel the hairs standing on end. Also, I've noticed with blonde girls and blonde hairs it is particularly sexy. I don't know if this is strange but because I am a hetereosexual male I only am attracted to women shivering with goosebumps because male does nothing for me. Some people I find also like both. I also love shivering and chattering teeth because they imply goosebumps too. I have almost never seen someone shivering uncontrollably without them.</p>

<p>Even though it's hot in summer, I find that in America summertime can be the best time for goosebumps since air conditioning is usually so strong and people wear next to nothing. Here is my favorite most recent story:</p>

<p>I was sitting in class a few days ago and the most beautiful asian girl walked in (I happen to have a massive thing for most asian women) and sat in front of me. She was slender and I would say about 5'8." She was wearing a black tank top and short grey shorts. It was quite cold in the lecture hall I would say 65 degrees and judging by how her hair was blowing gently, she seemed to be sitting right under a vent. As soon as she sat down I could see goosebumps all over her arms. Since we both got there kind of early she turned around and we chatted a bit before the lecture started. One of the first things she said was "I'm really cold, I really wish I had brought a sweater or something. But I was an idiot so I'll just shiver the whole class" (it was like a 3 hour lecture seminar.) I asked her if she would be ok just to be polite (I didn't have anything to offer her anyway) and she said "yeah I'll be fine. I'm used to having goosebumps. I have them more often than not." </p>

<p>Class then started and about 20 minutes in she started rubbing her arms really hard. Every 5 or so minutes her whole body would shiver and she would get more goosebumps. By about the 45 minute mark I could see her teeth chattering and they probably chattered constantly the rest of the class. After class was done she was shivering so hard she could barely pick up her things and her teeth were chattering so loud. I accidentally acted on my instinct which was to hug her (I usually restrain well) and I freaked out a second apologizing and she grabbed me back and said "I'm so cold and you're warm" after about a minute she left and bid me farewell until next week. (It's only a once a week lecture) Let's just say I have never looked forward to a class so much! </p>

<p>Hi Dae-Wong - it's good to hear from you again. I agree that blonde hairs standing on end are sexier than dark hairs though sun-bleached hairs on tanned skin look good too.</p>

<p>That's a lovely story. Please let us know what happens in the next lecture. I wonder if she'll bring a cardigan this time, or wear the same skimpy clothes? And will she sit under the aircon vent again? You could get there early and sit in the same seat and see if she joins you. I think you should invite her out for an ice cream after the lecture.</p>

<p>To me, ladies are most attractive if they are non-nude but wear a summer dress or short shorts and a short sleeved top for example. Legs and arms must be bare and covered in goosebumps of course. And the lady should ideally not show any sign of discomfort in her face or any tense in her body because of the cold. The contrast between a warm smile and a goosy skin is nice. Unintended shivers are very welcome, however!  </p>

<p>Hello, wildswimmer, great to hear that I'm not alone here. (I had to make a new account)</p>

<p>I do like being cold, not in a sexual way just I love winter and I don't shiver when I'm cold I just enjoy it. However seeing girls is sexual for me and my school has skirts as a year round uniform so there's lots of shivering in my school.</p>

<p>I was wondering if, since I shared, anyone had some free videos that include shivering or teeth chattering or even just shaking? I really could use some. Cheers.</p>

<p>Hey there. Sorry I was gone for one week. had a pretty busy time.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share another story with you all:
So it happened last March at a very rainy day/night. The weather in March in Germany is not that cold, but you hardly get above 10C(50F) at daytime.
I put on a black, very short mini-skirt, a sleeveless top showing off my bare midriff(without any underwear), and some heels and went to a disco in downtown, where I met my boyfriend.</p>

<p>It was not really cold that evening (around 8C or 46F) and I only had to walk 20 minutes, but it was pouring outside so arrived soaking wet.
I was really cold and had huge goosebumps, but I just smiling at him and gave him a kiss before we went inside. It was hot inside the disco and my clothes dried almost immediately.
We danced and drank almost 4 hours inside and he payed every single drink I ordered and it was just a amazing time.
Some time at 1 AM we got outside and decided to go to a more quiet area of the town.
It got a tiny bit colder, but it was still raining heavily
After 10 minutes I was dripping wet again and started to shiver a little. My bf noticed that very quickly and suggested to go anywhere inside. 
But I didn't wanted to disappoint him, so I just braved the cold and we kept going.
We had a very great chat and I got so many kind and sexy compliments from him, but after an hours minutes my feet really began to hurt, cause I'm not used to walk on forest path's in high heels.</p>

<p>So we sat down at a wooden bench near a beautiful lake.
Moments after we sat down the rain stopped, but it got very windy.
That was good, cause the wind blew all the clouds away and we now had an awesome view and the lake with the moon behind it.
But it got really freezing. At some point I just couldn't hold it back anymore and just started to shiver heavily and my skin got blue all over. 
It wasnt even subzero but my whole body was so wet and the wind coming from the front was just too icy for me. My teeth chattered really loud and my bf put me on his lap and cuddled me.
The warmth felt so good on my ice-cold, goosebumpy skin and I just felt happy. </p>

<p>After we cuddled there for at least 30 minutes I was like incredibly freezing and we went to the nearest bus stop and waited around 40 minutes for the bus. I was just freezing so much, my bf had to pay for my ticket, cause I couldnt even stretch out my hand.^^</p>

<p>Yeah so after that we went to my apartment again and spent the rest of the night there.</p>

<p>Hope my grammar was not too bad, XO July :3</p>

<p>Wildswimmer: Is it weird that whenever I see a girl with extremely hairy arms my first thought is "I wonder how big her goosebumps are?" There is a very attractive blonde girl in one of my classes that has extremely hairy arms and seems to be cold very easily because she almost always has goosebumps. As for my previous story, lectures are on Wednesdays so hopefully I'll have something to update in a couple days because I am curious about those questions too. I do plan to get there early to see what happens. Also, this is prime time for goosebumps because it's starting to get a little cooler but everyone still dresses in summer clothes and places still use air conditioning as much as ever. </p>

<p>Thanks for posting the photos, goosebumpsforever! Both models are stunning and those were amazing pictures! I too am interested to see if anyone has videos of teeth chattering and shivering. It's a lot harder to find on the internet than I would have hoped. </p>

<p>Well Wolfsbane I went ice skating many times in recent years.
Nowadays I'm quite good at ice-skating and almost never fall down, so most of the time I don't feel much colder than I would be anyways.</p>

<p>But back in the days when I was learning ice-skating, I was very uncertain and shaky and needed much time to learn it properly.
As a consequence I was skating very slow and fell down very often and my bare legs and arms often touched the freezing ice.
That was a quite shivering experience, indeed.</p>

<p>Actually I unfortunately broke through the ice 2 times in my life. Well but thats whole another story. :D</p>

<p>Ok, just as I promised, the continuation of my Macroeconomics Lecture Saga. So, this course is a once a week for 3 hours type course in the evening (basically so everyone can get it out of the way at once rather than going three times a week for one hour.) I'm sure that's not what you guys care about in the slightest so I'll skip to the good stuff.</p>

<p>I arrived as usual, sat in the same spot about 12 rows back, dead center. As soon as I sat down, the girl walked in the room. She waved and walked over to sit next to me rather than in front. To my shock she was still wearing a tank top and really short shorts but as she got closer I saw she was wearing a black cardigan, so my heart sank a little. We chatted a bit, as we talked I couldn't help but notice she was covered in goosebumps yet again. It was still probably 65F in the room, she wasn't directly under a vent this time but it was still quite cold. She started to rub her arms, and I asked if she was cold. She nodded and said "I'm freezing, can't you see my goosebumps?" I replied that they were kind of a give away, and she laughed and said "I'm always cold, I almost always have goosebumps." I asked her why she doesn't just wear the sweater, pointing to the cardigan in her hand (not sure why I did this) and she said "oh this isn't mine. I'm just returning it to a friend." Her friend eventually showed up and she gave the sweater back to her. I was expecting her to follow her friend to wherever she was sitting, but I was surprised she stayed put next to me. I asked her boldly (again not sure why I did this) why she dresses rather "lightly" if she's cold all the time. She laughed again and said "I really hope that I don't come off as a $%!@ by saying this, but I really like how I look in skimpy clothes. It makes me confident and I feel good about myself. I would much rather be shivering with goosebumps and look sexy, than cover up." It's actually seems to be a more common thing with women than you would think.</p>

<p>So the lecture started, and she progressively got colder and colder. By about the 20 minute mark her teeth started chattering and the chattered most of the remainder of the 3 hours class. When we took a break halfway, she was shivering so hard I couldn't help but hug her again. What I liked so much was that she didn't try to hide how cold she was, but she wasn't annoying or whiny about it. By the 2 hour mark she was shivering so hard other people were starting to notice. Her goosebumps were so big they probably felt like needles in her arms and legs. Finally when the class let out, we hugged one last time and through chattering teeth she said "s-s-s-seee you n-n-next w-w-week!" and walked off. </p>

<p>Hey there.
@Goose flesh fan, @Wolfsbane surely I can tell you both of the stories.
I begin with the "shivering while ice skating" stuff, cause Wolfsbane was first. Is that okay?</p>

<p>So that's a little longer ago. Winter almost 3 years ago I think.
I went ice skating with a very good friend of mine at a outdoor ice rink. 
She's very talented at sports in general and also a perfect ice skater. 
I wasn't at that time. Was maybe the third time I went ice skating.</p>

<p>It's quite a long time ago, I cant remember everything.
But I probably wore a really short shorts and a tank top and it was hardly above 0°C/32°F.
I already had little goosebumps as we arrived. As I first stept onto the ice I felt very uncomfortable and skated very slowly along the edge and slipped several times. 
But my friend(her name is Kimberly) helped me a lot and every minute I got better and better.
At the same time I got colder and colder every second, since my clothes got quite damp and we had a stiff breeze. 
Soon I felt some big goosebumps and slowly began to shiver.</p>

<p>After almost one hour I felt very good at the ice and went some laps without any help.
At that point I was shivering quite a lot, but it was so much fun, so we stayed approx. one hour. Now I had very huge goosebumps and my teeth were chattering loudly. Even Kimberly was cold, although she had a big coat and I only wore a skimpy hotpants and a thin tank top.
I was freezing cold all the way home, but it was a great day!</p>

<p>chilly kisses, July</p>

<p>Well it is only right that @wolfsbane gets first respond as you say he did ask first.</p>

<p>Another excellent account of some very sexy shivering and goosebumps, clearly Kimberly doesn't share your love of all things chilly, it's a shame that the UK doesn't get the freezing temperatures that you talk about.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion I have tried to get my wife to display goosebumps and shivering by putting the car air con as cold as it will go but she always turns it off before she gets gold enough to shiver and have chattering teeth.</p>

<p>I do however have a story from when we camped and she got that cold</p>

<p>Goose flesh fan: I am very eager to hear that story from when she got that cold!</p>

<p>Seminar Saga Week 3:</p>

<p>I arrived early like I always do, but by the time class started she wasn't there. I was quite disappointed since she was the main thing that made that long, boring lecture worth it. But, I sat there, took notes, did what I needed to do. Well, class ended and I left, hoping I would see her next week. Well, on Friday I was walking on campus and by sheer luck I ran into her. Now, it cooled down a bit so people are covering up more easily. Well, when I ran into her she was wearing a sleeveless sundress. She smiled when she saw me and hugged me. I asked her where she was on Wednesday and she told me she was sick. She got a terrible virus that she is still getting over. She said that she had a fever of 104 and the worst chills she has ever had in her life. She said she had her winter coat on and 3 blankets and her teeth were still chattering so hard like she was naked in the arctic. Her roommate took her to the hospital. While she was there, they said she needed to let the fever break so she had to strip down because apparently layering up can make the fever worse. She said she shuddered at the thought since she was already so cold, but she did what they told her and stripped down all the way to a white tank top and short shorts. She said that the second the air hit her bare skin she shivered like she never has in her life. She said that her ribcage was aching and her jaw was sore from chattering so much and her goosebumps felt like the hairs were trying to rip out of her skin. She would rub her arms and legs as hard as she could but basically she succumbed to shiver uncontrollaby with goosebumps until the fever broke. Finally after about 30 minutes the fever broke and she warmed up. But she said that after that experience most normal situations where she was cold felt like nothing, so even though she had goosebumps the whole time I was talking to her since she was in a sundress in 65 degrees, and shivered here and there she was barely bothered by it. She hugged me again and said she would DEFINITELY be there next week! </p>

<p>Hi guys! I'm new to this forum, but I've had a browse through some previous posts and I've been really enjoying everybody's stories. I live in Australia so it doesn't get all that cold here, although where I live is only a 2-3 hour drive from the Snowy Mountains so I sometimes go out there to 'cool off'. I've always loved people being exposed to the cold and shivering, and even moreso seeing people (I do have a preference for girls) wearing minimal clothing in obviously freezing temperatures. I admire the perseverance it takes to keep the same sort of wardrobe all year round, and it's great that they can be shivering with lovely goosebumps while still looking gorgeous!</p>

<p>I've only just moved into my own place and can start really getting into full exposure, plus it's still summer here, so I don't have too many stories to share yet but I will share this one, even though it doesn't compare to some of the tough stuff you guys have done!</p>

<p>The first time I drove through the snowies was pretty much the first time I'd ever experienced snow, and wasn't sure what to expect when I left that morning. I decided to wear something casual, just a tank-top and jeans (I'm quite conscious about my body image and that's what is most comfortable for me, so didn't bother trying to wear anything less), figuring that I'd be on the road all day and it gets quite hot in the car with the sun on it all day. I hadn't realised the temps had dropped until I got about halfway and stopped for a break at a little town somewhere in the peaks. The whole place was covered in snow, which was a totally new thing for me at the time, and it was far colder than the town I left from, maybe -3C or -4C in the middle of the day. I dabble in photography and thought it would be cool to take a look around, so I grabbed my camera and left the car and took a walk around town (which was pretty much deserted aside from the post office).</p>

<p>I felt the cold pretty quickly, especially since I wasn't used to it at all. I had goosebumps almost instantly, which were quite visible on my exposed arms, and it was barely a few minutes before the shivering started. I was walking around for maybe an hour in snow about 4inches deep, and since I'd only planned on driving I wasn't wearing snow shoes or anything, so my feet got pretty soaked and only helped to make it feel colder.  Eventually I was shivering hard enough that I could barely even hold my camera, let alone take a straight shot, but it felt awesome walking around being fairly exposed. It was a shame there weren't that many people around really! When I got back to the car it took me several attempts to even open it, my hands were so numb and shaking that badly, and once inside I had to sit with the heat up for nearly half an hour just to stop shaking enough to drive home.</p>

<p>Nowadays I almost always have the A/C cranked up when I'm in the car, and if it's cold I'll open up the windows to let the brisk air in. Now that I'm in my own place I can keep the house cold too without annoying my housemates, so this coming winter should be really fun. Looking forward to seeing more of your wonderful stories in the future too!</p>

<p>Hi Hypothermik, welcome!</p>

<p>Nice story and apropos cold house, I wonder if such a human being exists who could live in a chilly house at say 12C - 14C all the time, just wearing minimal clothes (bare arm and legs) and enjoy it! </p>

<p>Is it possible to train the body to produce enough heat and not get numb fingers and toes all day long. I mean if the body could be totally adapted to say 10 degrees lower temperatures than normal (20-22C), and not needing warm up time between chilly adventures. </p>

<p>Hey there</p>

<p>I totally forgot about this page. Had so much stuff to do in the last weeks. I'll be online more regularly now.</p>

<p>Yes, winter has finally arrived and we even had snow for some days here in northern Germany, which is quite rare in November. </p>

<p>I really love to wear minimal clothing when there is snow. I mean I like wearing minimal clothing in cold weather in general, but when it's snowing it feels just so much better. 
I work as a waitress and even though I have to wear a short black skirt, I can barely experience the cold when im at work, cause I'm indoors.
But I'm going to work by bike every day and thus I'm covered in goosebumps and slightly shivering every time I arrive at home. I absolutely love that feeling!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to a ice-cold winter!
Also this winter I'm going to do snowboarding again and this time probably only dressed in very skimpy clothing. I'm psyched!</p>

<p>And about 2 month ago I promised '@Goose flesh fan' to share a story, where I broke though the ice accidentally. I'll surely catch up on that soon. sorry. :3</p>

<p>chilly kisses

<p>Hey</p>

<p>It's just a normal restaurant, so I can't dress that skimpy. 
The dress is completely black, sleeveless and tight with the logo of the restaurant at the back, but showing a kinda moderate neckline and stops roughly 5cm above my knees. 
Just a normal short dress, nothing too fancy or sexy. Particularly because my butt is quite flat. :D</p>

<p>Outside the working time, I don't really wear tight dresses, unless its a special occasion.
I prefer wearing very short loose dresses and skirts or just Hotpant-Shorts and I really enjoy wearing crop-tops to show my belly.</p>

<p>Hi July,</p>

<p>And do you cycle to and from work wearing only your short sleeveless dress, even when it's sub-zero? Or do you wear something over it? And what do you wear on your feet? What about when it's raining? Or snowing? I love cycling in a very short-sleeved or sleeveless top when it's really cold.</p>

<p>Hey wildswimmer</p>

<p>I never wear something over it, regardless of the temperature or if its raining or snowing!
When the groud is icy and slippery in the winter, I sometimes consider to walk or take the bus, because I don't wanna fall off my bike. :D But besides that I cycle to and from work everyday. </p>

<p>On my feet I wear normal black leather shoes with a low heel almost everyday  Just something comfortable and kinda stylish to walk in the whole day. </p>

<p>And yes the icy feeling is amazing. But cycling wearing a crop top with bare midriff when it's freezing is a absolutely great feeling aswell. </p>

<p>hugs July</p>

<p>That's great to hear, July. You must be a lovely sight. How long does it take to cycle to work? And to walk? Maybe you could skip the bus in future because I'm sure it's heated in there, isn't it? Do people ever comment on your minimal clothing?</p>

<p>Well thank you. :3</p>

<p>It takes roughly 30 minutes by bike and more than an hour walking.
So I rather take the bike, cause cycling is not that time consuming.</p>

<p>And yeah of course its heated in the bus. I try to avoid the bus this winter!</p>

<p>Of course people comment on my clothing style. But not that often. I mean when I was walking down the streets downtown yesterday for example, I wore a white minidress and some shoes with small heel. I was kind of an eye-catcher, but only two guys commented me.</p>

<p>Most comments I get are compliments about wearing so little in such freezing conditions, my outfit, my body or me in general. 
Im always delighted about people commenting, even sexist or offensive people.
Obviously there are also a few people shouting at me that I should put some clothes on, that Im next in line for rape or insulting me as a $%!@ or other mean stuff. But thats fine with me and I don't feel offended by that.</p>

<p>Happy December, everybody! 
This is ColdLoverHS on a different account. It's been a while since anyone has posted material so I figure I start the month of right by supplying.</p>

<p>This new channel uploads about every week. The videos are all Ice Bath Challenges with decent looking women (in 1440k pixels), and judging by the uploaders comments during the video I can only assume that he is a psychrophiliac. Anyways, this specific one which was just uploaded has some crazy shivering mid-way through, including huge goosebumps.

<p>Hi July: I'm pleased you don't get offended by silly comments. It took me many years to stop caring what other people thought and said to me. Now if they make silly comments about my not wearing enough I just make a joke about it. Yes, try to avoid the bus and let us know if you walk for an hour each way in sub-zero temperatures in your sleeveless short dress.</p>

<p>Cold lover: I'm not sure how cold that water really was but she is cute and I enjoyed watching her enjoying being cold and shivering. Thank you for sharing it.</p>

<p>I no longer follow this topic because I received WAYYY too many emails, but I wanted everyone to know that there is a woman in this area who went bare-legged yesterday.  The high here was 44F.  (So it was probably colder by the time it got dark.)  She came to the daycare to pick up her kid while wearing a short miniskirt.  I believe that she plays tennis, and may have come straight to the daycare after playing tennis.  I have seen her wear miniskirts before, but that was in summer.  Sure was a nice treat to see her bare legs yesterday evening!  I'm sure that the other moms were looking at her like she was out of her mind, but she didn't seem to care, or even notice!</p>

<p>We never heard anything more from her since she was talking about how her boyfriend used to lock her in a freezer and occasionally open it only to douse her in freezing water and close the door again. She talked of him going out with his mates after locking her in there. I reckon he took too long to come back one night. It was a competition: coalburner against the National Grid. She was aptly named, but I reckon that one night she lost.</p>

<p>This forum is not so active at the moment, but it flourish from time to time when people post interesting stuff.</p>

<p>It seems that most guys prefer shivering ladies, like you do. Personally I am more into goosebumps. I like to see attractive ladies in short shorts and short sleeved top covered in goose bumps. They should like to dress minimally, but I don t mind if they suffer from the cold or shiver! </p>

<p>@Psychrophiliac,</p>

<p>Check out previous messages from coldjuly and lorna, for nice stories! 
Unfortunately, it seems we have lost them. </p>

<p>Do you have any plan for how to meet a nice girl who wants to enjoy you with shivering and goosebumps?  There are definitely a lot of them, but probably very hard to meet someone for a relation.</p>

<p>She should enjoy turning you on and be willing to dress in a way that gives the desired result, no matter if she has to suffer a great deal! Her amusement from your appreciation of her appearance must overtake her discomfort!</p>

<p>In the meantime, here are some nice pics</p>

<p>No, sadly I don't know that many girls who would like to shiver and freeze for me. But I'm fine with that. I usually like stories about girls shivering only because I don't see that happen very often where I live. :(</p>

<p>Hi Psychrophiliac, welcome! I have noticed that the forum traffic tends to come and go, but people still update every now and then. I too love seeing girls cold and shivering but rarely get the chance due to my location, and have had even less luck finding a girl who would do that sort of thing for me.
If you have time to sift back through previous posts I would definitely recommend it, there's a lot of good stories and links people have been posting and even though you have to dig a little for them it's certainly worth it!</p>

<p>This forum is pretty interesting. so many stories throughout the years! Only have time read the first few pages so far. may continue reading as I have time. I am from down south in New Zealand. Winter does get very cold and snow. 3 year ago, I found my first job after uni as a personal assistant to my boss, pretty young for a boss (who is now my bf ^^). As a PA, I have to follow him around every day, sometimes in the evening and even in weekends. As he goes out most of the time for meetings, and events, we don't stay in office much. And during my interview, I have been advised to dress up professional and formal most of the time. since may not have time to change (eg from a late afternoon event, and then to an evening function). I really want this job: 1) I get to dress up everyday; and 2) its such a cool job.</p>

<p>Since my first day of work, my arms and legs are always bare. I started the job in summer so the first few weeks was pretty good. and my boss love the way I dress. As autumn approaches and temperature started to drop, I tried looking for a jacket but was not able to match to my expectation so I did not wear it. It was cold and I get goosebumps often, and occasional shivering but not unbearable. My boss like having events outdoor as he enjoyed nature and only at the final stage involving paperworks that it would be indoor or at our office.</p>

<p>The first time I recalled I was freezing cold that I did not know who I survived was 3 years ago, I still remembered that day the temperature was between -2C low to 6C high because I did not have much to do except looking at my phone lol. It was a cold morning, woke up to -2C, I shivered the moment I left my bed until I got to work. When I arrived to work, 2 colleagues asked me if I am cold and said they have never seen me wore anything warmer. I told them its part of my job to wear like this everyday lol, and they were confused. I made myself hot coffee to stay warm, although the office is semi-heated, it is never warm enough for me because we don't want guys getting too hot and have to take their blazer off (my boss like everyone to be very professional looking). At least I stopped shivering, although still have goosebumps and still a bit cold. My boss gave me a rundown for the day and we are meeting one of his potential partners at their private deck on a hillside at 10am. When we got there, it was quite windy and I was trying my best to look professional and hide my shivers but I started shivering in waves. That's the thing about being a PA, when they are having a conversation, I have to stand still in professionalism in the background. That means I couldn't rub my arms, move my legs or blow on my hands. The only thing I cannot control is my constant shivering but I cannot help it.</p>

<p>After 30mins of talking, the other guy suggested going inside his office as it was freezing and windy. Both my boss and him were wearing multi-layers of clothing with scarfs while my dress is sleeveless and quite short. My thought was that they probably noticed how cold I was and decided to head indoor. But as we were heading inside, the guy told my boss that he would prefer the conversation to be private and asked me to have a seat on the icy bench on the deck. I nodded and took a seat while they walked inside. I took my phone out, it was 10:30am, slightly warmer 3C now. but the hilltop was windy and icy. I have never been that cold before in my life. At least now I can move around instead of standing still. I rubbed my arms and legs for warmth but useless. I alternated between standing and sitting. I was thinking about walking to my boss car and sit inside while waiting but that would make me look unprofessional and I did not know how long their meeting will take. After an hour, still no sign of them coming out. I don't know how long I can last in the weather. I don't even think I have any warmth left in any parts of my body. I just needed something to warm up. I think the only thing that kept me going was being professional and not let my boss down as his PA. At 1:30pm, they finally came out. I have been outside in a thin sleeveless short dress for 3.5 hours! Apparantly they had lunch inside as well. They shook hands, and I smiled at the guy and walked towards the car with my boss. I was almost losing my balance but I mentally told myself to use last bit of my strength to walk properly and not embarrass myself in front of my boss business partner.</p>

<p>When we were out of sight from the house, my boss looked at me and asked if I am cold. I told him why do you ask. He said he has never seen me so cold before. It is worth it if you are happy I said. And He replied back saying I am the best. He also mentioned it was mean of the guy not to let me go inside seeing I was wearing so little but he could not blame him as their conversation was confidential. He put his arms around me as we made our way back to his car :). His car felt like paradise (again like his office, its not the warmest possible as he doesn't like to put heater on high, but it felt good. He could not keep his eyes off my goosebumps shivering bluish arms and legs. That feeling, I had the feel that I have won haha :). He knew I did not have lunch yet and drove to a nearby café, asked me to stay in the car to keep warm and he got me hot chocolate and a sandwich. What a boss!</p>

<p>We made our way towards out next meeting at 3pm. At another outdoor place, with the wind calmer at ground level. Although I still shiver in waves, it was easy compared to the morning. It was dark by the time the meeting finish at 5, we went back to office and my boss invited me for dinner. As winter gets dark quite quickly, I spent a lot of time having dinner with him before going home that winter. We started dating towards the end of the winter season, and I moved into his house before the start of the next winter season (2yrs ago).</p>

<p>The day has not finished as the dinner and the evening was one of the highlights of my life and also one of my coldest (probably not the worst cold experience though). It was probably the day of my life. This is getting long and I am not sure if anyone wants to read on, but if enough interest, I will continue writing part 2 of that day, and possibly share other freezing stories I had over the past 3 years. I am still with him and enjoying our life together.</p>

<p>Hi guys, another story for you. My girlfriend and I were driving a couple hours out of town for a work function of mine when my car got an unexpected flat tyre, so we pulled over to swap it for my spare, which wasn't fun as it had been bucketing down with rain all day and was still going strong. As we hadn't been planning to get out of the car my girlfriend had left her jacket in the boot, so was only wearing a thin t-shirt and fairly short skirt. It was already quite chilly outside, with an air temp of about 4C/39F and an icy bite in the wind as we were driving through the mountains, and I could see she was cold the moment we got out of the car, goosebumps spreading all over her bare arms and legs and starting to shiver as the rain began to soak her. It took a good while to change the tyre, as I've never had to change one before, and by the time we finished she was completely soaked and shivering badly, and I could hear her teeth chattering as we got back into the car. It took her ages to warm back up again, especially since I kept the AC blasting the whole way. (:</p>

<p>@NZsilvergirl: Thanks for your story, that is, to the point, the most attractive situation I can imagine!  Eager to hear more! </p>

<p>Maybe you could find dresses made of a fabric that stretches over your nipples, so it is just visible how stiff they are when you are cold! Not too much, remember you are professional and classy, but still visible!</p>

<p>That will make many good contracts for your boss!     </p>

<p>Back on 2-05-2014, I posted this on page 105 of this thread:</p>

<p>"Yesterday here in Nashville, it was a dreary cold, gray, and rainy day. It was probably about 38*F here yesterday afternoon. I was at the Aldi store down in south Nashville when I observed an attractive woman there wearing SHORTS!! It has been such a long, cold, drab, gray winter here that it was certainly a treat to see a great pair of female legs completely bare for no apparent reason! To whomever you are, thank you for wearing shorts yesterday. You certainly brightened up my day! It was freezing cold yesterday, and drizzly, too. I was wearing layers myself. It definitely made my day to see that woman wearing shorts!"</p>

<p>I remember that day well, because it was the day that I had just gotten laid off from a truly awful temp job.  So it was such a treat to go to Aldi and see that woman wearing shorts on such a cold winter day.  It really lifted my spirits!  I would have rolled down the window and shouted out "NICE LEGS!!" to her, except that she was talking on a cell phone!  Bummer!  She cost herself a compliment by being on that damn cell phone! </p>

<p>I forgot the pw and the reset pw does not work. So this will be my new account. (to read my first cold experience, search the username NZsilvergirl) or click here: http://www.misterpoll.com/users/414681</p>

<p>Continuing on from that day. My boss took me to dinner after work at a restaurant. The restaurant was warm and warmed me up. After dinner, he asked if I had time to join him to take photos of the stars in the sky, one of his hobbies. It was a clear night with no clouds. Since I had nothing planned, I went along. He drove to a remote countryside, when I opened the car door, I shivered instantly, an icy breeze and it was even colder than the deck on the hill in the morning. I followed my boss to the trunk of the car where he took out his tripod and a camera bag. He also pointed to his spare jacket and asked me to wear it if I am cold. I told him I am fine. We walked for a few minutes to a grassy area with a bench by the lake. It was a nice view. After he set up his tripod and camera, he asked if we should have a seat on the bench. I preferred standing as I could move around a little for some warmth but I sat down with him nonetheless. It was so cold, I tried my best to make him look I was not cold but could not control my shiver nor my massive goosebumps. Every breeze of wind made me shivered even harder. My bare arms and legs were ice cold to the touch. It seem like he looked at me more than his camera lol.</p>

<p>After an hour, I was shivering so bad and my teeth chattered so loud that my boss actually asked if I am feeling ok or if I wanted to go. As he was not my bf at the time and I would not want to disappoint my boss, I told him I was fine and it was very refreshing with the icy breeze by the lake. He smiled and showed me some of the pictures he took. After about two hours, he said time to go home and sleep and to get ready for another busy day tomorrow. He drove me home and said I was his favourite employee. I smiled back, said thanks and see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>It was definitely a challenging day, in such a thin sleeveless short dress. I was surprised I made it through the 4 hours in the morning and the 2 hours in the evening. But it gave me confidence that I could survive the winter and looked professional. Most of the time was not too bad as I spent more time inside than outside. And most evening events were indoor. Still it was hard wearing so little, due to the amount of outdoor activities my boss had, and temperatue in office or in cars were not all that warm either.</p>

<p>Thanks again for a very nice story! </p>

<p>How do you feel when you realize that this is going to be chilly? </p>

<p>Do you like the feeling when your skin gets goosey and the body hair stand up, or are you just good at endure? </p>

<p>Do you even try adjust your dress so that it gives less protection from the cold when the temperature starts to be challenging, so you can show up as much cold and goosy skin as possible?     </p>

<p>I love it when women/girls wear hoodies or sweatshirts (or even long-sleeved t-shirts) over extremely short shorts.  That tells me that they may be "cold-natured" but still want to show off their legs!</p>

<p>The contrast between a warm, even oversized, sweatshirt and long bare legs is deadly attractive. And barefoot on top of that, is irresistible... </p>

<p>I'm afraid it's bare arms for me. Bare legs are a bonus but on their own do little for me. Maybe it's because the cool blood returning from cold arms will cool your core more efficiently.</p>

<p>Thank you NZSilvergirl for your stories. I too am interested in whether you choose your clothes deliberately to feel even colder. Perhaps you have a top which doesn't meet the top of your skirt so the wind can blow around your middle? Without looking unprofessional, that is.</p>

<p>I was once on a cycle tour at the top of an Alpine pass in a snowstorm when a father and daughter arrived in a car. The girl, slim with long blonde hair, was about 12 and was wearing a sleeveless dress - well it looked like a dress but in fact was a top and skirt which didn't quite meet - and open-toed sandals. It was suited for the weather in the valley but not here at the summit where the wind kept blowing it up slightly. She got out to see what view there was - the blonde hairs on her arms standing bolt upright. She was obviously frozen but didn't take any more clothes from their car. I like to think that was because she didn't have any. They wandered around for five minutes before getting back in their car and driving off. I wanted to take a photo but it would have been too obvious. But that picture is still in my mind almost 30 years later.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, good to see some responses. Thought this thread died since it was started up years ago. To answer a few of your questions:</p>

<p>No, I don't deliberately make myself to feel more cold. I wore short dress mainly as it would suit most situations, from formal meetings, work function, to evening balls, pub and bars etc. I don't adjust my dress in challenging conditions, but I don't think it matters as it would not make me any warmer or colder with what I wear. Most of the time its just my arms and legs and top part of my chest and shoulders are bare. Occasionally, I also wear backless dress. But I do like to look hot and sexy, and professional. I guess the first few months were hardest. As my boss was not my bf yet, and I wanted to do well in my job. I only wanted to impress my boss. So I just tried ignore the cold and the goosebumps. I wouldn't say like or dislike, but I do feel good about myself that I manage to withstand the cold. It was hard especially when outdoor for long period, but definitely satisfying.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago, the company is expanding and my bf asked me to employ another PA to help us out. Also free up my time while in office. The new PA dressed like me, except she would wear a jacket or a winter coat on her way to and from work but would take it off in office. About 3 weeks into her job, after a short meeting between me, my bf and her, we took her out for the first time. As me and my bf had 2 meetings in a row and needed her to help bring a few things back into office after our first meeting. Me and her followed our boss to his car and as the cold breeze hit her after the front office door opened, she said forgot to bring her coat. My bf has already rushed outside to get his car. I told her I will wait for her outside. Maybe she doesn't want us to wait, she said she doesn't need it and we headed out.</p>

<p>The meeting was with one of our business partners, the one with his office up on the hillside (the same one as I shared my first cold experience). When we arrived there, on the deck by the hillside, he saw the new PA so asked her to wait outside. I knew how it felt as it happened to me 2 years ago so I said I will wait outside with her. The weather that day was not too cold, 6C, with a cold breeze but still cold enough for the way we dressed. We sat down on the bench, both of us with our arms and legs covered in goosebumps and shivered in waves, for her a little more as she was probably not as used to the cold. After about 30mins, we alternated between sitting and standing for some movement, and also enjoyed the nice scenery of the view below. About an hour since we were outside, she asked if I know how long the meeting will take and if we come here regularly and if I have to wait outside everytime. I told her that only the first time I came I was asked to wait outside as he was only our potential business partners at the time and needed private conversation with our boss. The other times, I would go inside if they chose to have meetings indoor during winter, and we come 2-3 times a year.</p>

<p>After a little longer, both of us were getting very cold, visible from our skin colour, goosebumps and more frequent shivering. She asked if I am cold and how I coped being a PA for 2 years and outdoor a lot, and also mentioned that she never saw me wore anything warmer. I told her that it is part of the job, to be professional at any time as we won't know when we are needed. Like herself today, she chose not to let the boss wait and did not went back to her desk to get her winter coat when we headed out. She also asked me why we had to wear like we are going to a ball, would a look of an office lady with a suit jacket also quite professional. I then told her we are different to other female employees back in our office because we are PA and first in line with meeting important people. Also, mentioned to her what if we are attending an afternoon meeting and then straight to a dinner ball event or to a bar/pub/club, will be awkward and not too professional to have to get our boss to wait because we have to change and inconvenient to bring 2 sets of clothing to work everyday. She nodded, continued to shiver but did not complain.</p>

<p>We didn't have to wait too long, they came out after 2 hours. While I was quite cold myself, I could see that she was trying very hard to make herself not to look cold in front of our boss and other people. But her shiver, bluish skin, and goosebumps were too obvious. This is more of setting the scene and background about myself than sharing too much of my cold experience. I hope you guys don't mind. Next time, I will share my coldest ever experience in which I believed I had mild hypothermia that day.</p>

<p>Thanks NZsilvergirl for another great story and explanation!</p>

<p>Do you look forward to chilly days and situations where you will be freezing so you can show off goosebumps and professionalism?</p>

<p>Do you have any favourite dresses that you choose when you know you will be freezing and covered in goosebumps?</p>

<p>Personally, I find it very attractive when ladies wear dresses with very short puff-sleeve that leaves a tiny red line on the arm because of the elastic, when skin is cold!
You see it when she rises her arms to adjust her hair or something like that, and the sleeve moves a little!</p>

<p>Very sexy and perfect combination with goosebumps!   </p>

<p>Hi everyone! I can't believe I found this thread! I am a woman in my late 20's, and I LOVE not only seeing other women with goosebumps, chattering teeth, and shivering in the cold (I am bisexual), but I also love being cold myself. I've had this fetish for as long as I can remember, and I'm thrilled to have found others who share it! I have many stories about being cold. I love to seek out situations where I'm "accidentally" under-dressed in cold weather, or just happen to be freezing in front of other people, men in particular. I love it when men seem to enjoy seeing me freeze; it turns me on like nothing else!</p>

<p>Just today, actually, I found myself in such a situation. When I left my house, it was a very nice summer day, about 70 degrees F, and sunny. I was wearing short jean shorts and a light blue tank top with no bra ( my breasts are large, but perky, so I often choose to go without a bra.). I had the day off, so I decided to walk to a local bar, about a mile and a half away, for a couple of drinks in the afternoon. Just a few minutes after I left my house, it began to rain very, very hard. There was lots of thunder and wind, and the temperature dropped about 15 degrees before I even got halfway to the bar. I was immediately soaked to the skin, and I had goosebumps all over my arms and legs because of the wind and the temperature drop. My tank top was practically see-through because of the rain, and my nipples were rock hard and straining against the fabric. I figured there was no point in turning back now, I had come this far. Besides, like I said, I love being cold, so I was already a bit turned on. </p>

<p>When I finally got to the bar, I was (pleasantly) surprised to find that they had the air conditioning on full blast, despite the rain and the severe drop in temperature. I was completely soaked through, my hair was dripping wet, and my goosebumps got even bigger. I hadn't been sitting for more than a minute when I began to shiver. There were three other people (all men) at the bar, watching me from a respectful distance. I could tell they appreciated the view. I'm buddies with the bartender, so he bought me my first drink, since I had walked all that way in the rain. As he made small talk with me, I could tell that he was enjoying watching me. I was so, so cold at that point, being soaked to the bone and in the AC -- I was covered in goosebumps all over my arms, legs, and chest, my rock hard nipples were clearly visible through my soaked tank top, and my teeth were chattering. I rubbed my arms and said, through my chattering teeth, "I'm absolutely freezing!" I could hear one of the other patrons say, "They should turn up the air, this is a great view."</p>

<p>Eventually my bartender buddy offered me a smoke. I accepted, and we went out the back door. The temperature had dropped even more at this point, and it had gotten darker out and the wind had picked up. It was NOT the summer day it had been when I left my house; I was severely underdressed at this point, as it was now around 45 degrees and still raining and windy. As we smoked and made more small talk, my teeth continued to chatter. My clothes were still wet, and my tank top didn't hide much. I was covered in goosebumps, and I began to shiver in uncontrollable, violent waves with the gusts of wind. His shift was ending, so he offered me a ride home, after watching me shiver and shake a bit more. Being so freezing cold, I gladly accepted.</p>

<p>Like I said, I have many other stories of cold situations, including a dunk tank and a few situations with an ex, who loved to watch me shiver. If you guys want to hear more, or if you have any questions for me, let me know!</p>

<p>Well, invented stories can be nice but I think real stories are much more interesting.</p>

<p>Therefore I hope that NZSilvergirl and FreezingColdGirl are telling us true experiences from real life.</p>

<p>Otherwise I think we all have a dream picture of the freezing girl. 
Maybe she is tall and tanned with long blond hair, she wears an elegant summer dress with short sleeves and gladly lets cold air tantalize her skin so every little blond hair on her body is standing up. </p>

<p>She only showers with cold water to stay in shape and she likes ice hole swimming during winter. She amazes other winter swimmers when she demonstrates her body strength by lifting herself up from the ice hole to hand-standing on the ice and then makes a backflip into the cold water again!    </p>

<p>Yeah, but in real life if a girl like that did what you described, she'd freeze to death. But in a fake story, she could continuously get colder and colder, and never get warm again. So if we made up our own stories, not only could we make our dream girl a reality, but we don't have to worry about them getting too cold and going back inside to get warm.</p>

<p>She would always be in something skimpy, whether it be a short skirt or short shorts or even a bikini. She would always try to get warm, but would never succeed. She would shiver, day and night, and would try her best to warm herself to no avail. Her teeth would always chatter, and would never stop despite her best efforts.</p>

<p>That will be a tough life for your lady! Some women actually like being mistreated! Hope she will enjoy!</p>

<p>I think it is convenient if our freezing girl enjoys the feeling of being cold. She should ideally even get a little aroused when her goose bumps are growing and her nipples are stiffening. She should like showing bare arms and legs when other ladies prefer to put on more clothes. </p>

<p>I remember a New Year party when everybody went outside to watch the fireworks and there was one lady who did not bring her coat when she went outside. Maybe she was warm from dancing and wanted to cool off. Anyway she was a pleasure to watch. A true beauty, wearing an elegant mid length sleeveless evening dress, standing in the subzero temperature wind and enjoying the moment!</p>

<p>It should be fully realistic for a cold loving lady to do amazing things without risking her health, if she knows the limit when her body temperature starts to drop. There is a certain time from when our brain tells us to put on more clothes until we risk hypothermia. During that time, it is risk free to continue freezing if we can handle the discomfort or even turn the discomfort into something enjoyable!</p>

<p>Hi guys, it's great to finally find a page/forum that shares my interest in psychrophilia (or so I've self diagnosed myself with) </p>

<p>I've been reading through a few stories and some are great! I'm new to all this and I'm in my early twenties and from the UK. However this Limey bastard isn't homosexual before anyone beats me to it, and I do much prefer seeing Women struggle with cold as I'm a bit of a traditionalist and see it as something to instinctively protect them against.
Anyway, enough of my life story and on to a snippet of some important points of second hand experience!</p>

<p>Working in a busy service station between England and Wales enables me to witness hundreds of customers every shift, most of the time different to the ones I served the previous day. We have many large fridge units and in the summer I can sneak into the back office and whack up the AC too. </p>

<p>It was very recently when I did this and was lucky enough to have a skinny Business woman of about 30 years enter the premises and head straight to the Coffee machine, it was about 70 degrees outside but nonetheless I could see millions of goosebumps appear on her uncovered arms straight away, I went closer pretending to date check a few products in the fridge and she rubbed her arms very daintily and wrapped them around herself to protect her from the fridge she was losing her body temperature from.</p>

<p>Even though I'm fairly active inside the building, I find even motionless I don't get cold in there sometimes even in January.
Tactically, I joined the inevitably growing queue as it was close to rush hour, and I had a 50% chance of serving the lady in which I was lucky this time. I could see a couple of faint shivers erupt from her body even when she was 2 customers back. Male customers (mainly lorry drivers) had been inside for 4 times as long and didn't react to the temperature drop)</p>

<p>As I served the lady, I realized when she was up close that she had hardly any hair on her arms to insulate her and she had very tanned skin for a mousey blonde lady, so she wasn't used to these relatively chilly temperatures. She was about 5,10 with her platform heels, and her arms didn't increase much in size as she folded them tight to her chest.
I asked her slyly whether she was chilly, and she admitted whenever she's hit with the trace of any AC, her limbs turn into ice cubes. She was hiding the extent of her state a bit, but then a couple of minutes later, as she was browsing through some of the phone chargers, she exhaled a short sharp breath and her teeth chattered as fast as a cartoon characters, because she had quite a small teeth, they sounded really high pitched, almost like a girl of half her age. She promptly exited the garage with her arms wrapped tight and her jaw contracting at hyper speed </p>

<p>So yeah let me know what you think guys and I'm willing to share info on videos of ice bath challenges on YouTube that feature teeth chattering and even some clips I've found on clips 4 sale and picknpay.eu, but I would like some info/stories in return or even some links that have gone under my radar of teeth chattering females please!

<p>Outdoor performance in December 2010 by the K-pop group T-ara.  It was reportedly -18 degrees Celsius that night and the girl performers were out in short sleeved fishnet one-piece outfits.  You can see that the girls are not even able to maintain dance formation at some points because they are so cold.</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qPLXhOOeoA</p>

<p>One of the performers tweeted afterwards, </p>

<p>"People said it was still cold no matter how many layers of hanbok (traditional wear) they were wearing. Short sleeves and a fishnet one-piece... I'd like to apologize to the audience and TV viewers that were surprised. Even now, our car is filled with the sound of coughing."</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>"I seriously felt the mystery of the human body.  It felt like my skin was splitting, my joints were hardening, and my eyes were popping out of their sockets."</p>

<p>Nice find, Kreyser.  I recognize these girls.  They are from the K-pop group Red Velvet.  I've seen them perform on YouTube, and they are pretty cute even when they are not freezing.</p>

<p>My favorite part of your video is right at 3:24.  It looks like a sudden blast of freezing air must have blown down on them, because the girl in blue has a sudden uncontrolled shivering fit, and the one in the rainbow top to her right gasps visibly.</p>

<p>If you want to see girls with goosebumps I recommend you look for grid girls in cold places like Silverstone or phillip island like this: http://www.visordown.com/sites/default/files/article-images/5/51809.jpg

<p>Well it's October now. The time for autumn to really start and for those women who decided to wear the least amount of clothing possible complain that "It's cold." And don't get me started on Halloween. There'll be so many women in such small outfits freezing their butts off that they should be called a popsicle stand cuz they're FREEZING. Anyway, anyone got any cool stories to share?</p>

<p>So I used to dress up for winter, like coat, thermal stuff, the whole lot. Then in my last year in university me and some of my friends were going to watch a concert in the winter, and one of my friends, I'll call her Mary, suggested that we all pair up(there were 4 of us)and we would go shopping and chose each other's outfits for the concert. The concert was outdoor one too. So I paired up with Mary and we went shopping. I got her a yellow sundress and a 3" high chunky heel. When I met up with Mary I got the shock of my life, she was holding a black bandeau, a 6" micro skirt(I'm quite short, only 5 3") and I had to wear the skirt so far down to get it to cover my $%!@. I went home thinking I might survive because the temperature was usually around 50 f. The day itself in snowed the night before and the temperature was around 30f. Mary picked all 4 of us up and had some fun keeping the AC off. The other girls had long skirts and tshirts so they were faring much better. When we got out of the car I was shivering with huge goosebumps all over me. We found a place and before long my skin turned blue and I couldn't suppress my chattering, coughing and sneezing and had to be carried back to the car once the 2 hour concert was over and shivered until I went to bed that night.</p>

<p>That was my first time dressed like that and I got a cold and fever the next morning when I woke up. However I kept on thinking back to yesterday I never felt so alive before and I wanted to feel that again it felt so good. So wore a crop top and a micro skirt with slippers and went out for lunch with Mary. She was so shocked when she saw me wearing that and even more shocked when she learnt that I had a fever and asked me if I still wanted to go out. She normally has bare legs and arms but bare midriff she says is always too cold. We ate at a outdoor place, and I could barely use my utensils with my hand shivering. After that she asked me if I wanted a walk beside the sea. I'm not sure why but I agreed. So we walked to the beach and I had to force 1 leg in front of another. By the time we got to the sea about 10 minutes away I was frozen, if I wasn't already before. To make matters worse it started raining after about 15 minutes on the beach and Mary took out an umbrella but refused to share with me, and insisted that we continue walking. By the time we left the beach we maybe spent an hour there, I'm not sure I couldn't think by then. I was coughing, sneezing, shivering and chattering the whole time but seeing the looks from others were worth it:). I don't really remember the walk home I just remember leaving the beach I think I might have had hypothermia. Mary had to help me into my bed(we share a dorm) and my fever got worse after that but it was worth. Mary told me afterword the temperature was slightly above freezing the whole day.</p>

<p>I recently just found this poll finally found some people with similar interests as me. I'll share some of my stories too. I use to dress warmly in winter like most people. Once when I was 17 I went on a small vacation with my Boyfriend to a nearby cabin by a lake in the winter. As usual I packed all my coats and tights and well u get what I mean. The night before our trip my bf came over to my house and he asked me to help him get his phone from his car. While I was gone he went through my luggage and took out all my warm clothes and undergarments and replaced it with my shortest crop top and a 8 inch miniskirt and a 7 inch stiletto heel. He also offered to carry my luggage to the car the next morn so I won't notice the weight difference. When we got to the cabin it was evening and my only night warm. While I was showering my bf took my only warm clothes and locked it in the car. I was freaking out but he said that he liked me dressed minimally (actually he liked me to be cold but I didn't know then). I asked him what he meant and he opened the luggage and showed me what clothes I had. I was so angry but at least some clothes were better then none so I took them. He then turned off the heating in the cabin and I started to get goosebumps and shivered almost immediately. He told me that there was a rat in the cabin knowing that I was scared of them and I stupidly ran out of the cabin and got locked outside. It was about 40f at that time with a bit of wind and luckily sun. I was so miserable being outside I tried to keep myself warm by rubbing myself but after some time I couldn't even control my hands properly. I was outside for about 1 and a half hours before i blacked out. I woke up later in bed with blankets on me my bf told me I was asleep for 2 hrs and he gave me a warm bath before putting me in bed but I still felt so cold. The rest of the day I was given a break from going out but the cabin was still very cold I spent most of my time in bed.</p>

<p>I'll talk about my next day if you all want</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't post in awhile I'm a bit busy now. No I don't really mind the cold now I'm quite use to it going out. Anyway the second day my bf had me lie down in the snow on the porch of the cabin naked. I was a bit confused he eventually confessed his cold fetish with me. He then tied my legs and arms all to a tree or pole and I just lay in the snow while it snowed slightly around me. It was so bad I couldn't even rub myself or curl up to stay warm. I was shivering and blue by the time he carried me in 30 min later. My cold tolerance then was so bad. I couldn't stand being out for such a short time and felt so miserable. He rest of the day he realised how hard it was for me and didn't ask me to go out again. The heating still remained off though. The last day was the worst he brought me in the morning it was slightly below freezing I think and he said he wanted to go for a walk. So I went out with my only clothes I had. We walked for about 20 minutes and I was already freezing when we reached a lake. He asked me to jump in the lake. I obviously refused and he said that if I didn't go in we won't go back. So we stood there argueing for about 5 minutes when I realised how much more cold I was going to get so I just waded in. I wanted to get out immediately but my bf said that I had to dive under for at least 5 seconds. I was so cold at this point I just did what I was told. I thought I was already cold, but nothing prepared me for the lake it was so cold. I had difficulty getting out of the lake after that and wanted my bf to carry me back but he refused. So I had to walk back. I don't really remember the walk back I'm not really sure how I managed it. After that we packed up and went home without hearing the whole way. I fell asleep somewhere on the way back and my bf had to carry me from my car back to my home I couldn't get out of the car. The first thing I did at home was to crank up the heating all the way and swear to check my bag myself before going on a trip with my bf.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Glad to finally find some kindred spirits here :) I've done similar things for my boyfriend as well, he always loves to see me wearing revealing clothing and loves to see me cold and shivering on top of that. Through winter I am always so cold, some days I don't know how I do it haha.</p>

<p>Just after new years my boyfriend and I spent a few days at a cabin by the beach. It's one of our favourite spots and because it's a coastal park it's almost deserted over winter. We decided beforehand that I would give him a special treat and only pack my regular beach clothes (bikinis, tank tops, etc.), the warmest thing I had with me was probably my sundress because it covered the most amount of skin but even that was only very thin fabric, the wind blew straight through it :')</p>

<p>The first day wasn't too bad, when we left in the morning it was about 12C/54F, we drove the two hours to the cabin without heat in the car. I was wearing a thin tank-top and miniskirt and while it was a sunny day so the car warmed up a little, it was still pretty cold and I had goosebumps and some shivering by the time we got there. We unpacked the car and got settled in, the cabin wasn't very well insulated so the only real difference in temperature was the wind chill, which made me nervous but excited for the coming days. We went out for lunch after at this little diner which was thankfully only indoors, everyone there was surprised by what I was wearing but it felt good to be catching so many people's eyes.</p>

<p>We mostly hung out in the cabin for the afternoon with me still shaking a little from the chill, we sat on the couch and my boyfriend liked to rub his hands over the goosebumps on my cold skin and the warmth passing over me made me feel colder. Eventually we decided to go get dinner but as the sun had gone down the temperature had dropped drastically, it was about 2C/35F when we left with an icy wind coming off the ocean now. I got such a shock when we stepped outside and the cold breeze cut right through my clothes. My boyfriend noticed the difference too and I could see how turned on it made him so I stuck with it and we headed out. This time he managed to find a restaurant with an outdoor patio for seating and even though it had a few space heaters around I could still feel the icy chill and was shivering a lot through dinner, especially because he ordered ice cold champagne to go with it and then some small serves of ice cream for dessert, by which time I could barely get the spoon to and from my mouth, my teeth were starting to chatter pretty badly and I was worried they'd break on the spoon. :')</p>

<p>When we got back to the cabin I was really starting to regret my decision to do this but I couldn't back out now and it was all for him, so I tried to stay strong. As the front of our cabin was facing towards the ocean at the edge of the park we could sit outside without anybody seeing us, which he'd planned pretty well because he brought some handcuffs with him and asked to cuff me to the small front deck for some fun. This turned me on as well so despite the cold I agreed and he put the cuffs on me and kept the key in his pocket. He said that he would come back out in an hour and went back inside, leaving me stuck to the deck still wearing only my tank and miniskirt, and no underwear. It had gotten even colder as it was later in the night, he said it was around -3C/27F before he went inside, and I could feel it over every inch of my skin as I sat there shivering, the wind was so icy that it hurt whenever there was a strong gust. That hour felt like eternity, every minute I got colder and colder and my shivering kept getting worse until I could barely control my body at all. I had massive goosebumps and my nipples were so hard and poking so far through my shirt. All I could hear were my teeth chattering like crazy and my shaky breathing, and the cuffs rattling against the deck from how hard I was shaking. I couldn't feel my fingers or toes they were so frozen and by the time he came back out I was worried my bare butt would be frozen to the deck. Eventually he did come back out and untied me and took me inside for some pleasure which warmed me up a little but I still felt freezing afterwards.</p>

<p>I'll go over the night and the following day in another post soon. :)</p>

<p>Anyway so back on my trip, after that we went up to bed, he had all the covers on his side and I only had the single cotton sheet naked. I didn't know this (though my boyfriend probably did) but it was forecast to snow that night, so it got extremely cold through the night and I could hardly sleep with how cold I was. I tried to snuggle up to him as best I could but through all the covers I got no body heat. I doubt he slept much either, he was probably so turned on by me shivering violently up against him all night. :')</p>

<p>When we got up the next morning I was allowed a warm shower and then we sat outside on the deck while we ate breakfast. The snow was several inches deep and it was so cold that morning (I think it was about -12C/10F) that it was really hard and icy, and there was a thick fog over the park and the beach. That day I was wearing my bikini top and 8" mini skirt and even though I'd warmed up a bit from my shower I felt even colder than the day before after just a few minutes outside, our breath was visible in thick clouds and I wash shivering within a couple of minutes. It was sooo hard trying to eat with my shaking hands and chattering teeth and by the time I finished the food was practically iced.</p>

<p>After that we had some fun as he ran his hands over my huge goosebumps and played with my rock-hard nipples, all the while I couldn't stop shivering under his touch. I accidentally bit his lip when we were making out because my teeth were chattering out of control. We then went for a walk along the beach, he was dressed in full winter gear with gloves and boots and everything and I only had my skirt, bikini top and flip-flops. The sand was really wet and icy even up close to the land from all the snow and the moist air but at least it was a little better than walking on the snow had been. We walked for maybe an hour and the whole time I absolutely froze, the wind was really biting and there were a lot of cliffs either side of the beach so there was lots of spray coming from the ocean that made my hair (which was still damp from my morning shower) even more wet and it started to form bits of ice. He told me it warmed up a couple of degrees as we walked but it was still well below freezing and I felt no difference, my hands and feet were so sore and almost numb and it was a struggle to walk, and my skin was really red and starting to turn blue.</p>

<p>As we were heading back he said mischievously that since I was dressed for the beach I should go for a swim. I knew the water would be even worse and fervently shook my head no (my teeth were shaking so bad I couldn't have made a compelling argument if I tried), but he insisted and I gave in and waded in up to my waist. The moment my feet went into the water I started getting cold shock and had to take gasping breaths, it was so cold it didn't even actually feel cold, it was just painful and stinging and got worse the further I went in. I stopped at the waist and begged him to let me come back out but he said I had to go fully in. I just wanted it over with so I dunked my whole body in for only a second but it was enough. I think I blacked out for a couple of seconds from the shock of it before ambling my way back to shore, he held his arms around me as we walked back to the cabin. My shivering was so bad I was practically convulsing and could barely manage to walk and all my extremeties were totally numb so it took us nearly three times as long to get back up the beach. By the time we got back I had ice all in my hair and my skirt and top were practically frozen solid, my lips and skin were really blue and I couldn't stop shaking for hours. I wasn't allowed to dry off but he sat me down on the couch and let me have one of the blankets from the bed and a cup of hot coffee (he could only half fill the cup because otherwise I would spill it since I couldn't stop moving), all I could do was sit there in a daze thinking about how utterly cold I was. He cuddled me and played with me some more until I warmed up a little bit but I was shivering violently like that for hours, I was so tired and sore but it was still cold all day and I shivered all through it. We took it pretty easy for the rest of the day and had sex once or twice to warm back up, but it only lasted until it got dark again and he had more stuff planned, but I'll cut it off here.</p>

<p>We have been ice skating a couple of times, I haven't really worn any 'special outfits' but even during winter my usual attire is thin shirts/tank tops, skirts, booty shorts and dresses, so I've had some very cold times out on the ice. I'm pretty ok at skating so I didn't have direct contact with the ice but in open-air rinks it was still super cold and really hard to stay upright from shivering and my icy skin. (:</p>

<p>I remember back when I was in middle school, the cheerleaders always wore their mini-skirted uniforms to class on game days.  Sometimes, on really cold days, they would wear their cheer sweaters with jeans instead of the skirts.  (boo-hiss!)  But on days when photos were being taken for the school yearbook, the girls had to wear their skirts for the photos no matter how cold it was!  The winter that I was in eighth grade, I believe that we had snow on the ground for six weeks or more that winter!  But in all the group photos of cheerleaders in our yearbook that year, they were ALWAYS wearing the skirts!  Even in the band photos, the cheerleaders are all sitting right there on the front row, all proudly showing off their legs!  And as I recall, it was REALLY cold that day!  And the bandhouse is NOT connected to the school!  That meant some walking outside for our girls that day!</p>

<p>Hello everyone, i would like to share with you some of my psychrophilic adventures which i hope some or most will enjoy :) Ehem, a year ago i was in a relationship with a very interesting girl, blond, petite, crazy and sexually open to almost everything, i was the first one to introduce her to the fetish of cold, she was somewhat reluctant at first but interestingly over time it became sexually arousing for her as well. One of our first experiences, i told her to step in a cold bath wearing white panties and a white t shirt, then i slowly started showering her with freezing cold water as well, she was almost instantly shivering and chattering, after 5 minutes she was starting to be really cold and hugged me for some warmth which i didnt allow for long, i showered her freezing soaked boobs and butt for another 5 minutes before letting her out, she was almost convulsing and never shivered like that in her life before, but was still horny and i warmed her up nicely after i undressed her :). Tell me if u would like to read more of my experiences :D</p>

<p>Hi I am a girl who never dresses for the winter always bare legs arms midriff. I don't really like feeling cold but the looks I get make up for it. I had a decent cold tolerance even before I started showing off my body in the winter and the past few years have really improved it so I can stand being out for hours minimally dressed now. Here is one of my experiences tell me if you all want to hear more:). So I was going to my bf friend birthday and my bf told me that a lot of other girls were planning to be dressin to be very little. The forecast was about 25F and it was quite warm for that time so I guess the girls were feeling bolder. I already had a reputation of dressing very little so I had to live up to it. That night I wore a 5 inch miniskirt that had a 2 inch slit down a side (I'm only 5 feet 5) that sat below my hip and a little bit of my buttcrack showed yet it barely covered my pu55y. On top I wore a bikini top and 7 inch heels with 1 inch platform. My bf was so excited when he saw my outfit he couldn't wait to show me off. When we arrived at about 7pm it turned out my bf was right the girls were wearing quite little. Most had at least a bit of leg bare and some had their arms bare one had a bit of belly showing but none were as bare as me the boys couldn't take their eyes if my figure all night. But after dinner we went to drink hang out in the backyard and quickly realised that the temperature had dropped drastically and the thermometer on the door read 10F. A lot of the girls couldn't take the cold and some actually put on tights or jacket. I cold tell a lot of them were waiting for me to show signs of being cold but I managed to suppress my shivering. Some of the girls were so jealous they even offered me a jacket. We partied the whole night. Sometime in the night it started snowing and by the morning the temperate was -2F some girls went home in the night I could tell they were frozen they kept hugging and rubbing themselves. In the morning we were preparing to leave when one of the guys asked me if I was wearing a bodysuit. I shocked him by answering no and he touched my stomach and was shocked. After that the girl who had her midriff bare challenged me to see who could last in the cold longer. I was suprised she lasted the whole night and she didn't even look very cold, but after the party I found out from my friends that she had thermal underwear and heat pads what a bitch. I was already having troubles suppressing my shivering but I couldn't back down so I said yes. She went back in the house and came out in a swimsuit( the 1 piece kind) guess her stomach was too cold) while I just stripped in the backyard. We then floated in the pool for 10 minutes before we came out and were blasted with fans. I could not longer suppress my shivering and chattering teeth but I didn't want to lose. The girl wasnt really shivering yet I was really impressed and a bit scared I was going to lose (she had heat pads under her swimsuit) after 20 minutes we were dunked by a bucket of cold water each before we had to lay down in the snow after another 20 minutes some guys shoveled snow and buried us in I was shaking so hard I kept knocking off the snow. By another half hour of so I was losing consciousness when the girl finally quit. I had to be carried out of the snow I could hardly feel much less move my legs. But when I warmed up enough to walk me and my bf left. I went home and took my cold shower before falling asleep still shivering.</p>

<p>Do you all want to hear my other stories?</p>

<p>Many good stories, it would be nice if anybody is able to produce videos or have Videos with shivering/freezing girls. But It's difficult to find models who are willing to shiver in a video. </p>

<p>Thanks for the positive feedback:)</p>

<p>I was very cold after being buried in the snow my hands feet and arms were numb and my hair started to freeze too.</p>

<p>My boyfriend doesn't have a cold fetish like some of yours but he loves to show me off dressed very little regardless of the weather. I also don't really like the cold but I do it to show off my slim figure and I kind of get used to the cold after so many years anyway.</p>

<p>So someone requested a swimming story so I'll post about one of my most memorable ones. Me and some of my friends were in the woods hiking/trying to show off how long we could last in the cold. I don't remember how cold it was but maybe around 25F it was sunny and not really windy so quite a nice day. We came across a river that was frozen over and I dared my friends to walk across with me. Only 2 of them dared to. We were halfway across when the ice broke and one (I'll call Susan) fell in. Then it triggered some kind of chain reaction and the whole river started to crack and me and my other friend (I'll call Mary) fell in too.i was nearest so I reached the other side first and when Susan tried to climb up the bank I pushed her back in. She grabbed my hand and I fell back in with her and we had some sort of underwater wrestling trying to get up the bank while Mary crawler up the bank and sat there shivering. Susan finally managed to get up the bank without me pulling her back down and she and Susan spent the next 10 minutes or so pushing me back down with a branch. I might have been able to get up if I wasn't so cold but my fingers were already losing feeling so after a while I just floated in the river. Susan and Mary eventually went upriver to a place where the ice looked thicker and crossed without issue while I tried to swim back. I was shivering so badly I couldn't even grab onto a branch one of the boys stretched out to me it took me a few tries. When I got out even the small wind was so cold my skin was blue the other girls dried off but I didn't and aftet when we started to walk again I kept falling down and my bikini started to freeze. I was lucky we were only about half an hour away from our motel by the time we got there I had stopped shivering I was exhausted and probably close to hypothermia. The next day when I woke up I had a cough and a fever.
I'll continue the story if you all want this was a 3 day trip so plenty more cold experiences especially with so many other girls who had good tolerance too.</p>

<p>I don't remember which bikini I was wearing at that time sorry but I think it was black?</p>

<p>Anyway here's my second day. I woke up in the morning and right away I knew I had a fever. I took my temperature and it was 98F but I couldn't admit I got sick from the cold yesterday so I decided to tough it out. I was shivering almost immediately when we stepped out of the building for breakfast. During that time one of my friends hugged me and immediately realised how warm I was and knew I had a fever so by the time breakfast was over almost everyone knew I was sick, which made me even more determined not to show I was cold. After breakfast we walked about an hour to a nearby hill we decided to climb. It was even colder than the day before (18F with wind) but I managed to suppress my shivering the whole walk. We climbed halfway up the hill and was getting tired so we looked for a spot to sit down for a while. I saw a spot that was quite flat so I walked towards it not knowing it was a snow drift. I got buried almost to my neck and had to be dragged out by my boyfriend. After that I could no longer control my shivering, chattering teeth and never ending sneezing and coughing. The snow made the wind feel even colder and adding with my fever, I knew I was near my max but I didn't say anything. We reached the top of the hill and stayed there for a while playing in the snow while I tried to keep myself warm. We then walked back down the hill and back to the motel while going down the hill I kept falling down I knew I was close to hypothermia. I was so wet from all the snow which stuck to my body and everytime the wind blew my whole body shook violently sometimes my boyfriend would hold me so I won't fall I was so miserable. We were only out for about 6 hours but it felt like so long the temperature when we got back was 10F I couldn't wait to snuggle with my boyfriend in bed to warm up when one of my friends suggested we go to the bar. I was so tempted to go back to my room but I forced myself to go. The alcohol helped a bit but honestly I was too cold to care. By the time we got back it was past midnight but I don't really remember much of the bar or the walk back. I was told that I fell asleep once while walking back and my boyfriend had to catch me and he basically carried me the whole way back and put me on our bed which I lay shivering for several hours. It was one of the coldest experiences I had since I only stopped wearing winter clothes not long before this trip it really improved my cold tolerance.</p>

<p>I'll do the 3rd day when I have time</p>

I also wanted to ask how did you find all those friends that had such a high tolerance to the cold? And if you happen to have another story involving swimming or something similar please do share it.. Love your stories.</p>

<p>Here's another story guys, last year i was on holiday in Barcelona with my girlfriend, it was 15. October and we were on a 2 day trip to a little coastal place called Lioret de mar, we hungout at the beach with 3 girls we met and were drinking. After some time i proposed that we play a game of extreme dare or dare, the rules were do something or jump in the sea, the air temp was 13 degrees celsius, not frigid but cold enough, especially for Spain that time of year. Naturally everyone's dares were horribly nasty so just after the second question one girl jumped in, screamed and jumped out, she was shivering and chattering the moment she sat back down on the shore. After that i dared my girlfriend to eat a fist full of sand, she refused and jumped in the cold sea as well as the girl which was next in line for the same dare. All the girls were in their panties, and one was also wearing a white t shirt. I gave the most horrible challenges to my girlfriend and the tallest and skinniest girl of the 3 we met, my gf was a pettite blonde girl with a miserably small tolerance to the cold which i liked. About half an hour later my gf had jumped in 4 times, she was shaking so bad and said her hands and feet were starting to go numb. The skinny tall girl was uncontrollably shivering and her lips started to go a bit purple. Also i jumped in twice and was moderately cold but not even shivering. After another 20 minutes the skinny girl we met said she was just 2 cold and pleaded with her friends to go back to our hotel, i persuaded them that we all jump in the sea together one more time and then head back, which we did. I made out with my shivering gf for a minute in the water then we headed back to the hotel, the skinny girl, her friend and my fg were so frozen it took us twice as long to get back to the hotel then to come to the beach. The security couldnt believe we went swimming, he spent 5 minutes with us in the lobby making sure we were hotel guests, the lobby btw had a freezing ventilation system, i remember how the tall girls arms and head were violently shivering in the elevator, she was holding her bra squeezing the water out of it, saying her boobs hurt from the cold, back in the room i stripped my gfs wet panties and had some fun with her to warm her up, tommorow we actually continued our game at the pool :)</p>

<p>I had succes, on youtube find pixel atenas or Cinibel gomez and request a custom video, they complied with my ice bath video request, also find the Wetlook gossin site and send him a mail with a custom requested video. Just dont ask for anything 2 extreme and they will agree also behave like you just found them and slowly make the deal so they dont price you 2 much.</p>

<p>Hello Jacq, i loved your story about the freezing time you spent with your boyfriend and the video you posted is wonderful, also i liked the way you stood naturally while shivering. I hope you wont get offended by my offer but would you perhaps be interested in making a custom shivering video for a decent amount of money, both the video and price negotiated of course...</p>

<p>@daewongkim11 Yes I had really big goosebumps the whole time, when I rubbed my arms and legs I could really feel them, it was a real turn on. I drove home with all the windows open so it was still really cold, but when I got home it took me well oven an hour or so to stop shivering and I still had goosebumps when I went to bed.</p>

<p>@davidmenkovic Thank you! I would be interested, but it would depend what you ask for as I film them by myself. If you want you can email me at jacqui.sadler@hotmail.com and we can talk about it :)</p>

<p>I'd like to read more about your experiences!</p>

<p>I'm a guy that likes the cold, and it makes me horny just thinking about a girl feeling cold!</p>

<p>Do you know if there's a group to share "psychrophillic adventures"? Maybe a group in facebook!</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>I haven't read all of your stories.... but the few of them that I've read are pretty interesting!</p>

<p>I like cold weather! I don't endure a lot, but I like other people wearing little clothes!
Specially women!</p>

<p>When I see a guy wearing little clother in winter, I think "hey, that man's brave"... But when it's a girl... Wow... I can't describe what I feel! Not only do I think that she's brave, but I also think she's sexy, open minded and cool... </p>

<p>I love to see girls wearing little clothes... Maybe it's a fetish (There's a paraphilia called "psychrophilia"), but it's just so exciting! I also like when girls go barefoot or show their navel, specially when it's cold!</p>

<p>Do you know about a facebook group where I can interact with other people who either enjoy the cold weather or enjoy watching other people getting cold?</p>

<p>Can you share the link?</p>

<p>Yes, the video is good, but the camera nervos and it is dark. It would be much better if the video were made in daylight and the camera Stands still. It's very difficult to find such videos. </p>

<p>It s four and a half minutes long. Do you want to see more? You ll just have to use your imagination. In mine, they just drive away and leave her there helpless - all night long. I dont mind at all that it was shot at night. I just wish the video quality were better so we can see her goosebumps. Maybe if you pay to download it?</p>

<p>I love to see women and girls go out on cool and cold days wearing oversized sweatshirts and hoodies over extremely short shorts.  Sometimes, it looks like they don't even have any pants on!  On days like this, these are the only girls still showing bare legs in public.  It's like they want to (try to) stay warm, but yet, they still want to show off those legs!  I love that look!</p>

<p>Last Friday night, it was cold, and we were out to eat at Krystal.  There were three girls there from the local private school, all of them wearing their short-skirted school uniforms.  One girl's skirt was what I would describe as CHEERLEADER SHORT!  After eating, all three of them left, and ventured out into the cold delightfully bare-legged.  None of them made any attempt to wrap their legs in anything warm, as they apparently had not brought any such thing in which to wrap up, anyway.  All three of them left their legs deliciously bare, despite how cold it was that evening!  Apparently, these girls must wear these short-skirted uniforms to school every day, no matter how cold it gets!</p>

<p>At one time, in the '60s, Catholic schoolgirls had to do the "kneeling test," to make sure that their skirts touched the floor when the girls knelt down on their knees.  Now the schools actually ISSUE skirts that are ALREADY short to the girls!  No need for them to "roll up" the skirts anymore!  The skirts are already short!  The schools issue them that way!</p>

<p>Last night, got to see another mini-skirted schoolgirl from a local private school (this one a coed school!) out on a cold night.  She was wearing a sweatshirt over her skirt.  Her skirt was not quite as short as the other girls that I saw recently, but her skirt was still comfortably above her knees, and was fingertip length.  I would estimate that the temperature last night was in the 20s, 30s at most.  Yet this girl was at a local store last night with her legs deliciously bare!  I would have liked to follow her outside afterward to see how she handled the cold dressed that way, but I had not paid for my own purchases yet.  </p>

<p>hot cold hot cold. you guys are control freaks. tell ya what you get hot when you don't get enough attention. you get cold when you get too much. Yet if you really got too much attention you'd stop doing it. Satisfying infantile needs is a long endeavor. I'm not sure what would be the magic word for this. School. Do you sense in your life that in school there is too much stability and you need to have some chaos?</p>

<p>After all, if you are getting away with this, perhaps there is too much stability in the outer world. The internet, one webpage can get viral in just 10 minutes. You guys might be sensing too much chaos in the Internet, not enough outwards as a relative comparison? Come on, misterpoll is a old themed website. Do you miss the old days of the Internet anyone? </p>

<p>Maybe a few of you think of power outages, where the heater is now off... there goes another one of your imaginative stories... of a fictional character that is vulnerable (so direct) </p>

<p>Hallo, ich möchte mich gern in deutsch mit euch austauschen, da mein Englisch nicht so gut ist.  Vielleicht ist es ja die falsche Jahreszeit, aber ich hoffe auf eure Antwort. Mein Sohn hat eine ganz liebe Freundin, sie hat eine Top Figur und trägt fast immer ziemlich freizügige Klamotten. Jetzt im Sommer kein Problem, da sind viele Mädels so unterwegs. Sie war aber auch in der kalten Jahreszeit ständig so gekleidet und dann natürlich die einzige. Wir waren im Winter manchmal gemeinsam unterwegs, wir alle in normaler Winterkleidung und sie fror und zitterte in Ihrem Minirock und knappen Top. Ich sprach sie wiederholt darauf an, ob es ihr nicht zu kalt sei, sie meinte aber immer , dass ihr die Kälte nichts ausmachen. Bei einem gemeinsamen Ausflug letzten Winter, waren wir wirklich lange draußen, sie war stark erkältet mit nackten Beinen, Armen und bauchfrei total am Zittern, ihr ganzer Körper von Gänsehaut bedeckt, erklärte ich meinem Sohn, dass sich seine Freundin unbedingt mal etwas aufwärmen muss. Er fragte sie barsch , ob es ihr wirklich zu kalt ist und wir wegen ihr den Ausflug abbrechen müssten. So kannte ich meinen Sohn überhaupt nicht. Sie wirkte erschrocken und konnte mit klappernden Zähnen kaum antworten,dass mein Mantel ihr Outfit ruinieren würde und sie für uns gern sexy Klamotten trägt. Ich habe vorher noch nie jemand, so extrem frieren sehen. Ihre Gänsehaut war schon fast bläulich, ihre Beine zitterten so stark, dass sie Mühe hatte eine Treppe zu steigen und sie konnte ihre Glühweintasse nicht in der Hand halten, weil nicht nur ihre Hand, sondern ihr ganzer Körper zitterte. Ich muss gestehen, dass ich sie dafür bewundere, aber ich habe auch Angst,dass sie mit ihrer Gesundheit dafür bezahlt. Sie war wirklich oft krank. Soll ich meinem Sohn stärker ins Gewissen reden? Zur Zeit macht sie eine extreme Diät, weil er sie noch schlanker sehen möchte. </p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hello, I want to talk with you in German because my English isn’t that good. Maybe it’s not the right time of the year, but I hope for your answers.</p>

<p>My son has a lovely girlfriend; she has a top notch figure and is wearing pretty revealing clothes almost always. Now in the summer, that’s not much of a problem, many people walk around like that. But she was also dressed like this all the time in the cold season and of course the only one then. Sometimes, we did something together in the winter, all of us in normal winter gear while she was freezing and shivering in her mini skirt and scanty top. I asked her repeatedly, if she wasn’t cold, but she always replied that she didn’t mind the cold.</p>

<p>On a trip last winter, we were outside for a really long time and she was sick with a cold, but was sporting bare legs and arms and was wearing a crop top. She was shivering all over and her whole body was covered in goosebumps. So I explained to my son that his girlfriend should really cover up for warmth. He asked her harshly if she really felt too cold and if we had to cut short our trip because of her. I was surprised by my son acting like this. She seemed terrified and with her chattering teeth, she could barely answer that my coat would ruin her outfit and that she like to wear sexy clothes for us. I had never seen anyone freeze that extremely before. Her goosebumps were almost bluish, her legs were trembling so strongly that she had trouble climbing some stairs and she could almost not hold her cup of mulled wine any more, because not only her hands but her whole body was shaking.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I admire her for that, but I also fear that she pays for it with her health. She really was sick quite often. Should I appeal to my son’s conscience? These days she’s on a rigorous diet because he wants to see her even slimmer.</p>

<p>Hallo, sie trägt auch im Winter nur kurze Miniröcke und fast nie eine Jacke. Wir waren zum Beispiel gemeinsam zur Silvesterparty. Dabei waren wir von Mittag bis weit nach Mitternacht nur im Freien. Mein Sohn hatte seiner Freundin zu Weihnachten einen weissen Stretchmini und ein dazupassendes Bandeautop aus weissen Stretchmaterial geschenkt. Sie probierte die Teile Weihnachten sofort an und sah mit ihrem braun gebrannten Körper darin total sexy aus. Mein Sohn meinte auch gleich, dass das ein geiles Silvesteroutfit wäre. Ich wunderte mich schon und sagte: Aber wir wollen doch draußen feiern. Seine Freundin meinte, Wenn es nicht zu kalt ist, kann ich es doch mit einer schönen Jacke auch draußen tragen. Als wir Silvester starten wollten ,hatte sie tatsächlich diesen sexy Minirock und das noch knappere Top an. Darüber eine bauchfrei Jacke. Am Fussgelenk trug sie ein Fusskettchen. Sie fragte, welche Schuhe sie anziehen soll. Mein Sohn sagte, dass die Kette reichen würde und sie ihm barfuß am besten gefallen würde. Als wir vor der Tür standen, bemerkte ich sofort ihre Gänsehaut auf ihren nackten Beinen. Es waren vielleicht 7 Grad Celsius. Ich sagte ihr, dass sie in dieser Jacke  bei diesen Temperaturen nicht gehen kann und blickte dabei auf ihren Gänsehautbedeckten bauch. Mein Sohn sofort: Stimmt, man kann dein Top kaum erkennen. Sie zog die Jacke einfach aus und sagte: ihr habt Recht, bei den Temperaturen brauche ich wirklich keine Jacke. Schon während mein Sohn die Jacke wieder wegschaffte, fing sie im kalten wind an zu zittern. Ich konnte nicht glauben, dass sie so den ganzen Tag draußen bleiben wollte. Dazu kam noch, dass sie schon seit Wochen erkältet war. Sie meinte nur, kein Problem er mag mich nicht in einer Jacke. Bis zum Abend kühlte sie immer weiter aus, musste immer schlimmer husten, konnte nur noch mit klappernden Zähnen sprechen, zitterte unglaublich, aber war guter Laune. In der Nacht kühlte es sich vielleicht auf 2 Grad Celsius ab. Ich fror in meinem Wintermantel, Stiefeln und Handschuhen. Sie aber war barfuß, fast nackt und ihre Gänsehaut fast lila und eiskalt, ihre Lippen blau. Ich holte uns einen heißen Glühwein, sie konnte ihre Tasse nicht mehr halten, sie schaffte es auch kaum noch an ihrer Zigarette zu ziehen. Mein Sohn konnte seine Hände nicht von ihrer Gänsehaut lassen und fragte: ich finde dich so geil, dir wird es doch nicht zu kalt,  oder? Sie: Du machst mich heiss.
Als wir mal kurz allein waren, sagte ich ,dass sie ihre Gesundheit ruiniert. Sie meinte aber, dass sie alles für ihren Freund tut und ihn nicht enttäuschen darf.
Soll ich ihn davon abhalten?</p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hello,</p>

<p>she only wears short miniskirts even in winter and almost never a jacket. We were at a silvester party for example. For that, we were outside from noon till midnight. For christmas, my son had given his girlfriend a white stretch mini skirt and a matching bandeau top from white stretch fabric. She had tried the pieces on immediately and looked totally hot in them with her tanned body. My son promptly announced that this would make a wicked outfit for silvester. I was surprised and said: “But we want to celebrate outside, don’t we?” His girlfried just said: “If it isn’t too cold outside, I can maybe wear it outside with a nice jacket.”</p>

<p>So as we wanted to leave for the silvester party, she was indeed wearing this sexy mini skirt and the even skimpier top. Over that a midriff-baring jacket. At her ankle she wore an anke bracelet. She asked what kind of shoes she should wear. My son responded that the bracelet would be enough and that he liked her best when she was barefoot. When we were standing outside of the door, I immediately noticed the goosebumps on her bare legs. It was around 7 degrees Celsius maybe. I told her that she cannot go out in that jacket in these conditions and was staring at her midriff covered by goosebumps. My son instantly agreed and said: “True, we can hardly see your top.” So she just took off her jacket and said: “You are right, with these temperatures, I really don’t need a jacket.”</p>

<p>Even when my son was just putting away the jacket, she began shivering in the cold wind. I could not believe that she wanted to stay outside like this the whole day. And to make matters worse, she already had a cold for several weeks. She just said: “It’s no problem. He just doesn’t like me in a jacket.” During the time until the evening she was getting ever closer to hypothermic, her cough was getting worse, she was shivering horribly and could only talk with chattering teeth. Yet, she was in a good mood! During the night, it cooled down to about 2 degrees Celsius. I was freezing in my winter coat, boots and gloves. She, in contrast, was barefoot and half-naked; her goosebumps were almost purple and icecold and her lips were blue. I fetched a cup of hot mulled wine for us, but she couldn’t hold her cup any more. She also hardly managed to take a pull on her cigarette. My son couldn’t keep his hands off her goosebumps and asked her: “I find you so sexy; you’re not getting cold, are you?” She responded: “You are making me hot.“</p>

<p>When we were alone for a second, I told her that she is ruining her health with this. But she asserted that she were doing all of this for her boyfriend and that she must not disappoint him. Should I keep him from treating her like this?</p>

<p>Schade, dass Sie keine Fotos von Silvester haben, wo sie barfuß und schlecht gekleidet ist. Es ist sehr interessant, sich ihre Haut und Gänsehaut anzusehen. Sie mag es, in einen kalten Hahn gekleidet zu sein, damit Sie ihren Sohn nicht aufhalten müssen. Ich denke, sie wird in der Lage sein, bei einer Temperatur unter 0 ° C zu gehen. Was andere lange Spaziergänge im Schnee waren barfuß und fast nackt mit ihr?</p>

It would be very intriguing to look at her skin and goosebumps. She loves to dress scantily for her boyfriend, so you don’t have to discourage him from treating her like that. I think she will be able to go out in sub zero temperatures. Have you ever taken a walk with her when there was snow on the ground and she was barefoot and half-naked?</p>

<p>Dann mag ich auch etwas auf Deutsch beitragen:
Es ist schon viele Jahre her. Meine Freundin und ich hatten uns sehr gestritten und ich war fürchterlich wütend auf sie und wollte mich eigentlich von ihr trennen. AM Ende fanden wir zu einem Kompromiss:
Sie würde den ganzen Winter, wann immer wir zusammen waren, in superkurzen Röcken und nackten Beinen herumlaufen.
Wir wohnten damals in verschiedenen Städten. Wenn sie mich besuchte, stieg sie aus dem Auto in solchen Röcken und kam zu mir in die Wohnung. Wir gingen so einkaufen, spazieren, ins Konzert (einmal mussten wir im November bei sehr kaltem Wetter eine lange Zeit draußen vor der Tür warten, was natürlich für eine wahnsinnige Gänsehaut sorgte)  usw.
Hin und wieder verschärften wir die Situation durch kaltes Wasser. Es gab in der Nähe meiner Wohnung einen Springbrunnen, der auch im Winter noch an war. Dort ging sie in einem solchen Rock und einer dünnen weißen Bluse hinein. Sie war klatschnass und nach einer Weile zitterte sie vor Kälte. Sie musste dann noch den Weg zum Auto in den nassen Sachen zurücklegen...
Ein anderes Mal wuschen wir das Auto, sie in den gleich Klamotten. Natürlich bediente ich die Wasserspritze und auch dabei wurde sie mitten im Winter klatschnass... </p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Alright, then I will also share something in German:</p>

<p>It was many years ago. My girlfriend and I had had a bad fight and I was terribly angry at her and actually intended to break up with her. But in the end, we found a compromise: She would sport super short skirts and bare legs the whole winter when we were together.</p>

<p>Back then, we were living in different cities. When she was visiting me, she used to get out of the car in such skirts and join me in my flat. We would then go for a walk, shopping or to a concert. (Once we had to wait a long time at the door in November with very cold weather, which led to some crazy goosebumps of course.) Sometimes, we would aggravate her situation throught cold water. There was a fountain near my flat, which was also turned on in winter. She went into that fountain with such a skirt and a thin white blouse. She was soaking wet and after a while she was shivering from the cold. Then, she still had to walk back to her car in her wet clothes.</p>

<p>Some other time, we washed her car, while she was wearing the same clothes again. Of course, I was operating the spray gun and she was getting wet all over in winter again.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin.</p>

<p>Die meisten Leute hier haben diesen Fetisch und würden nur nach Fotos fragen oder Sie bitten, sie unter schlechteren Bedingungen noch härter zu schieben. Ich möchte Ihnen helfen, Ihnen die Informationen zu geben, die ich kenne.
Beachten Sie, dass ich Google Translate verwendet habe, auch weil mein Deutsch nicht ausreicht.</p>

<p>Ich muss zugeben, dass ich auch diesen Fetisch habe, aber ich möchte niemals, dass eine Frau gesundheitliche Probleme hat.
Ich wollte auch, dass meine Frau sich im Winter weniger anzieht, und habe viel recherchiert, bevor ich sie gefragt habe. Ich wollte nicht, dass sie krank wird oder gesundheitliche Probleme verursacht.
Der menschliche Körper kann sehr harten Bedingungen standhalten, und eine Person kann ihre Kältewiderstandsfähigkeit verbessern, indem sie gegen die Kälte trainiert.
Wenn Sie ein durchschnittliches Mädchen auswählen und es unter den gleichen Bedingungen wie die Freundin Ihres Sohnes anziehen, wird es möglicherweise schwer krank und hat sogar Unterkühlung.
Das Herz-Kreislauf-System verbessert sich selbst und gewinnt Widerstand gegen kaltes Wetter und kann den Widerstand gegen Unterkühlung signifikant verbessern.
Wenn eine trainierte Person wie sie in einem sehr kalten Zustand bleibt, drückt ihr Körper so viel Blut zu den inneren Organen und hinterlässt kaltblütige Extremitäten (Arme, Beine und auch die Haut). Auf diese Weise kann der Wärmeverlust erheblich reduziert werden. Wenn ihre Haut beispielsweise um 15 Grad kälter wird, verringert sich die Wärmeübertragung von ihrem Körper nach außen erheblich.
Auch der Körper hört auf, Blut zwischen außen und innen zu übertragen, daher können sich das Blut im Gehirn und in den inneren Organen warm halten.
Dies kann auch einen seltsamen Effekt haben. Zum Beispiel ist eine Person für lange Zeit in einem wirklich kalten Zustand und das Blut in den Extremitäten wird noch kälter. Wenn er sich dann in eine wärmere Umgebung begibt, mischt der Körper kaltes und warmes Blut, sodass die Extremitäten nicht beschädigt werden und Sauerstoff enthalten können. Aber wenn das Blut in großen Mengen zu kalt ist, kann es die Innentemperatur tatsächlich um weitere 2-5 Grad senken. Von 32 bis 28 und kann Unterkühlung verursachen, selbst nachdem sie an einen warmen Ort gelangt sind.
Die zweite Verbesserung betrifft das Körperfett.
Das Körperfett schützt vor Kälte. Und nach vielen Kälteexpositionen verbessert Ihr Körper die Qualität (nicht die Menge) dieses Fettes und schützt so die inneren Organe für eine längere Zeit.</p>

<p>Ich kann Ihnen diese Beispiele mitteilen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuNdpxnm7k
auf englisch: Galina Kuteryova
Ihr russischer Name: ÂÂ°Â»Â¸Â½Â° ÂÂÂÂµÂÂÂ²Â°</p>

<p>Suchen Sie auch Wim Hof, "Eismann".</p>

<p>Sie trägt Kleider oder Miniröcke, obwohl sie sehr alt ist. Sie hat eine große Resistenz gegen Kälte durch Training.</p>

<p>Zuletzt meine Empfehlung an Sie;</p>

<p>Wenn eine Person zu hart nährt, würde dies ihre Widerstandskraft verringern. Weil sie weniger Energie hätten, um Wärme zu erzeugen.
Und auch Fett hilft bei der Isolierung. Darf ich sie nach Größe und Gewicht fragen? Wenn sie zu viel verliert und zu untergewichtig wird, können sich ihre Organe nicht mehr selbst schützen.</p>

<p>Obwohl sie großen Widerstand leistet, hat der Körper Grenzen.</p>

<p>Ich denke, Sie können ihren Zustand der Unterkühlung an ihrem Bewusstsein erkennen. Wenn sie aufhört zu reden oder nicht richtig zuhören oder reagieren kann oder anfängt, Dinge zu vergessen, bedeutet dies, dass auch ihre innere Bluttemperatur deutlich gesunken ist und Sie oder Ihr Sohn definitiv reagieren sollten. Andernfalls können ihre Organe bleibende Schäden aufweisen, wenn sie ohnmächtig wird.
Ich glaube, sie wurde nie so schlimm kalt. Ich muss sagen, dass ich nicht erfahren genug bin, um das mit Sicherheit zu sagen. Wenn ihr jedoch immer kalt wird, ohne dass sie zu krank wird, kann dies bedeuten, dass es ihr nicht schadet, wenn sie nicht stärker pusht, und sie kann dadurch ihre Widerstandskraft verbessern.
Sie haben erlebt, wie sie unter diesen Bedingungen widersteht. Wenn Sie feststellen, dass Ihr Sohn versucht, noch mehr Druck auszuüben, wodurch sie das Bewusstsein verliert, sollten Sie auf jeden Fall damit aufhören.</p>

<p>Wenn sie auf Reisen gehen, bei denen Ihr Sohn sie in sehr kalte Gegenden bringt, in denen sie sich nicht gut angezogen hat, sollten sie einen Platz haben, um sich zu schützen, wenn ihr zu kalt wird.
Wenn sie zum Beispiel alleine auf einen Berg klettern, ohne dass Menschen in der Nähe sind, hätten sie keinen Ort, an dem sie sich aufwärmen könnten. Und wenn sie unter Unterkühlung leidet, könnte sie nicht selbst laufen und sogar sterben, wenn Ihr Sohn sie nicht zur Wärme bringen kann.
Wenn Sie Fragen haben, können Sie hier schreiben oder mir eine E-Mail an anonymousmusmus [at] yahoo [dot] com senden.</p>

<p>Hi Martin. </p>

<p>Most people here have this fetish and would just ask for photos or ask you to push her even harder in worse conditions. I wish to help you with giving you the information I know.
Note that even because my German isn't enough, I used Google Translate.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I also have this fetish, but I would never want a woman to have health problems.
I also wanted my wife to dress less in winter and made lot's of research before asking her. I didn't want her to get sick or cause any health problems. 
Human body can actualy withstand very harsh conditions, and a person can improve their cold resistance by training against the cold.
If you pick an avarage girl and get her dressed in same conditions as your sons girlfriend, they might get badly sick and even have hypothermia. 
Cardiovascular system improves itself and gain resistance against cold weather and can improve resistance to hypothermia significantly. 
When a trained person stays in a very cold condition like her, their body pushes as much of blood to internal organs and leaves extremities (arms, legs and also the skin) with cold blood. This way it can reduce the heat loss significantly. For example, as her skin gets colder to let's say 15 degrees, heat transfer from her body to outside reduces significantly.
Also the body stops transfering blood between outside and inside, therefore the blood in the brain and internal organs can keep warm.
This can also have a weird effect. For example a person is in a really cold condition for long, and the blood in extremities get even colder. Then when he/she moves into a warmer environment, body mixes the cold and warm blood so that extremities wouldn't get damaged and can have oxygen. But if that blood in extemities is too cold, it can actually reduce the internal temperature by 2-5 more degrees. From 32 to 28 and can cause hypothermia even after getting to a warm place.
The second improvement is about the body fat.
The bodies fat makes insulation against cold. And after lot's of cold exposures, your body improves the quality (not quantity) of this fat, therefore protects internal organs for a longer time.</p>

<p>I can share you this examples:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuNdpxnm7k
in english: Galina Kuteryova
Her name in Russian: ÂÂ°Â»Â¸Â½Â° ÂÂÂÂµÂÂÂ²Â°</p>

<p>Also search Wim Hof, "Ice man".</p>

<p>She wears dresses or mini skirts even though she is very old. She has a great resistance to cold by training.</p>

<p>Lastly, my recommendation to you;</p>

<p>If a person is dieting too harsh it would reduce their resistance. Because they would have less energy to produce heat.
And also fat helps insulation. May I ask her height and weight? If she looses too much and becomes too underweight, her organs wouldn't be able to protect theirselves.</p>

<p>Even though she has great resistance, the body has a limit.</p>

<p>I think you can understand her state of hypothermia by her consciousness. If she stops talking or can't listen or react properly, or start forgetting stuff, it means that her internal blood temperature has also fallen significantly, and you or your son should definitely react. Otherwise her organs may have permanent damage if she faints. 
I guess she didn't ever became that badly cold. I gotta say that I'm not experienced enough to tell that for certain. But if she always gets cold to that level without getting too sick, it might mean that it wouldn't harm her if she doesn't push harder, and she can improve her resistance by doing that.
You have experienced how she resists in those conditions. If you realise that your son tries to push even harder that causes her to loose her consciousness, you should definitely stop it.</p>

<p>If they go to trips where your son gets her to really cold areas with no good dressing, then they should have a place around to shelter if she gets too cold.
For example, if they climb to a mountain alone without people around, they wouldn't have anywhere close to warm her up. And if she has hypothermia she wouldn't be able to walk herself and she may even die if your son can't move her to warmth.
If you have questions, you can write here or send me an e-mail to anonymousmusmus [at] yahoo [dot] com.</p>

<p>Hallo  anonymousmusmus,</p>

<p>du hast mir mit deiner Antwort sehr geholfen und mich beruhigt. Sie hat sich durch ihren Kleidungsstil wahrscheinlich schon sehr abgehärtet. Sie trug im vergangenen Winter fast nie angemessene Winterkleidung und ich muss zugeben, dass ich sie sehr attraktiv und sexy finde, wenn sie in der größten Kälte nur einen Minirock und ein kleines Top auf ihrer Gänsehaut trägt. Ich musste auch feststellen, dass mein Sohn sie dazu drängt oftmals barfuß zu laufen und sie davon abhält sich zwischendurch aufzuwärmen. Sie hält aber tapfer durch und beklagt sich nie, auch wenn sie ihr Zittern und Zähneklappern nicht mehr kontrollieren kann. Wenn ich sie darauf anspreche, wie blau ihre Lippen schon sind und das sie sich noch weiter erkälten wird, sagt sie nur, dass für meinen Sohn immer nackte Haut zeigen muss und sie ihn nicht enttäuschen möchte. Ohnmächtig habe ich sie noch nicht erlebt, aber sie ist ständig stark erkältet. Darüber mache ich mir schon große Sorgen. Mein Sohn meint ihr Husten kommt vom Rauchen. Das simmt, sie raucht sehr viel, aber sie ist definitiv fast ständig erkältet mit Husten, Schnupfen, Halsschmerzen und teilweise Fieber
Jetzt im Sommer ist ihr Kleidungsstil kein Problem, aber ich mache mir Sorgen, weil sie weiter abnehmen möchte, sie ist 175 cm groß und wiegt vielleicht 52 kg, hat also kein Fett als Isolierschicht. 
Ich hoffe er wird nächsten Winter vernüftiger und erlaubt ihr wenigstens eine Jacke zum Minirock und nackten Beinen auf ihrem zu dünnen Körper.</p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hallo anonymousmusmus</p>

<p>your answer really calmed and helped. She has probably toughened herself a lot through her dressing style. Last winter, she was almost never wearing appropriate winter clothing and I have to admit that I find her very attractive and sexy, when she is only wearing a mini skirt and a small top on her goosebumps. I also had to observe that my son often urges her to go barefoot and keeps her from warming up in between. But she is bravely sticking it out and never complains, even if she cannot control her shivering and the chattering of her teeth any more. When I tell her how blue her lips are already and that she will worsen her cold like this, she just dismisses me and lets me know that she always has to flash some bare flesh for her son and that she does not want to disappoint him.</p>

<p>I ahve not seen her faint yet, but she does constantly have a cold, about which I am indeed very concerned. My son says her coughing is coming from smoking. And it’s true that she smokes a lot, but she definitely is almost always sick with a cold resulting in coughing, the sniffles, a sore throat and also sometimes a fever.</p>

<p>Now in the summer, her dressing style is not a problem, but I am very concerned because she wants to lose more weight. She is 175 cm tall and weighs maybe about 52 kg, so she does not have much isolating fat. I hope he will come to his senses next winter and will at least allow her to wear a jacket with her mini skirt and bare legs over her overly slim body.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin99,</p>

<p>zunächst ist dein Sohn zu beglückwünschen, dass er eine so hübsche Freundin hat und dass sie so verliebt in ihn ist, dass sie sogar hungert und friert nur weil ihm das gefällt. Und wenn ich deine Postings so lese, dann findest du sie selber ja auch ganz sexy. Umgekehrt machst du dir viel zu viele Sorgen. Ja, sie ist sehr dünn und wenn sie keine Fettschicht hat, dann kann sie nur zittern um sich warm zu halten und dadurch verbrennt sie noch mehr Kalorien. Meine Liebste ist genau so dünn (172 cm, 46 kg) und weil sie einen anstrengenden Job hat und auch in ihrer Freizeit viel Sport macht, sieht man bei ihr jede Rippe und jede Muskelfaser unter der Haut. Obwohl ich selber weder schlank noch sportlich bin, gefällt mir das extrem gut. Ihr konkaver Bauch macht mich unbeschreiblich an. Und weil sie das weiß, geht sie natürlich auch bei jedem Wetter mit kurzem Rock und bauchfreiem Tops und klar hat sie dabei eine Gänsehaut und schnattert vor Kälte. Wir haben uns im Sommer kennen gelernt und da waren ihren Klamotten ja nothing special. Wie es aber dann immer kälter geworden ist, ist bei mir natürlich auch der Beschützerinstinkt eingeschlagen und ich hab ständig versucht, sie warm zu halten. Sie umgekehrt hat genau das zum Anlass genommen, mich damit heiss zu machen. Und wenn ihr das gelingt, dann ist sie happy ... und ich auch. ;-) Mag schon sein, dass die Freundin von deinem Sohn tatsächlich körperlich leidet: Wenn sie wirklich so streng Diät hält, dann hat sie klarerweise ständig Hunger und spürt die Kälte noch mehr. Und wenn sie in der Kälte zittert, dann ist das für so ein zartes Mädchen natürlich eine Quälerei. Aber irgendwie ist das so ein SM-Ding. Die Bewunderung, die sie von ihm (und auch von dir !) kriegt, macht das wett für sie und sie fühlt sich sexy und begehrenswert. Wenn sie so drauf ist, wie meine Freundin, dann macht es sie total an wenn ihr jemand mit der warmen Hand über ihre Gänsehaut und den zitternden Waschbrettbauch streichelt. Hab bei ihr mal bemerkt wie ihr Magen geknurrt hat. Als ich ihr gesagt habe, dass sie komplett ausgehungert sein muss (was sie auch war), ist sie abgegangen wie eine Silvesterrakete. Also: sie leidet vielleicht, aber sie genießt es.</p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hello Martin99,</p>

<p>first of all, I have to congratulate your son for having such a pretty girlfriend that is so much in love with him, that she even starves herself and freezes just because he likes that. And if I’m reading your posts correctly, you find her pretty hot yourself, as well. But you worry too much about her. Yes, she is quite thin and if she doesn’t have insulating fat, she has to shiver to keep herself warm, burning even more calories in the process.</p>

<p>My darling is just as thin (172 cm, 46 kg) and because she has an exhausting job and alsp plays lots of sports in her free time, you can see every rib and every fiber of muscle underneath her skin. Even though I am neither slim nor athletic, I like that very much. Her concave stomach turns me on beyond description. And since she knows that, she will of course go out in short skirts and crop tops. And of course, the frost gives her goosebumps and makes her chatter. It was summer when we met and her clothes were nothing special then. When it grew colder, my protective instinct got stronger and I always tried to keep her warm. But she took that as an opportunity to tease me. And when she can do that, that makes her happy … and me as well. ;-)</p>

<p>It may be true that your son’s girlfriend suffers: If she is really keeping to such a strict diet, then of course she will always be hungry and feel the cold even more. And when shivering in the cold naturally is torture for such a delicate girl. But in some way that has to with SM. The admiration she receives from him (and from you!) makes up for it and she feels sexy and desirable. If she is like my girlfriend, it will really turn her on to feel a warm hand caressing her goosebumps and her shivering washboard abs. Once I noticed her stomach grumbling and when I told her how starved she must be (which she was) went off like a New Year rocket. So: She may be suffering, but she’s enjoying it.</p>

<p>Hallo IcemanX,
auch ich möchte dich zu deiner sexy Freundin beglückwünschen. Du hast großes Glück, eine Freundin gefunden zu haben, die für dich alles macht, um dich glücklich zu sehen. Ich muss zugeben, dass auch ich es extrem sexy finde, wenn ich sehe, wie sexy schlank und gut gebaut die Freundin meines Sohnes ist. Auch sie treibt viel Sport und hält eine strenge Diät ein. Eigentlich kann ich meinen Sohn gut verstehen, dass er so eine sexy Freundin nicht unter langen Klamotten verstecken möchte. Letztes Wochenende hatte ich das Vergnügen mit beiden Essen zu gehen. Zwar ist jetzt Sommer, doch am Abend wurde es empfindlich kalt. Sie trug wie immer einen knappen Mini, war barfuß und heute auch nur ein winziges, total rückenfreies Top auf ihrer Gänsehaut. Schon bei der Begrüßung konnte ich ihren zitternden Körper spüren. Außerdem war sie schon wieder total erkältet. Doch mein Sohn wählte einen Tisch im Freien, damit seine Freundin Rauchen konnte, wie er es begründete. wir sassen also draußen, ich schräg neben seiner Freundin und mir wurde bewusst, wie schlank sie geworden ist. Auch bei ihr kann man jede einzelne Rippe sehen, kein Gramm Fett unter ihrer braungebrannten Gänsehaut konnte sie wärmen, nur zitternde Muskeln versuchten sie warm zu halten. Sie zitterte fast noch mehr, wie im Winter. Ich gab ihr Feuer und versuchte sie dabei fest zu halten, fragte sie: Ist es dir nicht viel zu kalt? du bist total erkältet und  schlug vor nach drinnen zu gehen. Sie sagte: Solange euch es nicht zu kalt wird, bleibe ich gern hier draußen. Die Erkältung vergeht schon wieder. Der Kellner brachte uns Decken. Wie legten die Decken auf unsere Beine, mein Sohn sah seine Freundin erwartungsvoll an. Sie gab ihre Decke dem Kellner zurück und sagte mit klappernden Zähnen und leuchtenden Augen: Danke, aber so eine Decke ruiniert nur mein Outfit. Ihr war wahrscheinlich wirklich sehr kalt, aber du hast recht, sie geniesst es wahrscheinlich auch im mittelpunkt zu stehen. Der Kellner kam immer wieder an unseren Tisch, um nach unseren Wünschen zu fragen und der Freundin ihre Zigarette anzuzünden, sie berührte dabei zufällig mit ihrer nackten Haut immer wieder seine Hand. Wie ist es bei deiner Freundin, geniesst sie auch die Blicke und Berührungen Fremder? Kommt ihr eigentlich auch aus Deutschland? Mein Sohn gab die Essenbestellung auf und fragte seine Freundin, ob sie einen Salat möchte. Sie antwortete, dass sie heute noch nichts gegessen hätte. Darauf meinte mein Sohn zum Kellner: Stimmt, meine Freundin ist auf Diät. Da reicht ihr bestimmt eine Zigarette.
Doch als mein Sohn kurz weg war, kam mein schlechtes gewissen wieder durch und ich sagte: Du rauchst eh schon viel zu viel, bitte nimm wenigstens einen Salat, ich höre deinen Magen schon knurren. Sie nahm meine Hand und legte sie erst an ihren Bauch, dann auf ihren zitternden Oberschenkel und sagte: Fühl doch mal, überall noch Fett. Ich: Nein, du hast doch kein Fett, das sind nur Muskeln und bitte nimm eine Decke, du frierst doch und bist total erkältet. Sie: Ist schon kalt, wir waren den ganzen Tag im Regen unterwegs, aber ihr seht mich doch gern im sexy Outfit, das hat dein Sohn ausgesucht und für ihn nehme ich gern noch weiter ab. Er steht auf schlanke Frauen und doch auch? 
Was soll ich tun? Ich finde es ja auch sexy, sie so schlank und leicht bekleidet zu sehen, aber ich sehe auch, dass es ihrer Gesundheit schadet. Ist deine Freundin auch so oft krank? </p>

</div>
<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hallo IcemanX,</p>

<p>I, too, want to congratulate you on your sexy girlfriend. You’re very lucky to have a girlfriend who does everything for you to see you happy. I have to confess that I, too, find it extremely sexy to see how sexily slender and well-built my son’s girlfriend is. She does a lot of sports and keeps to a strict diet. Actually, I can understand that my son doesn’t want to hide such a sexy girlfriend under long clothes.</p>

<p>Last weekend, I had the pleasure to go out to eat with them. It is summer now, but in the evening it does get quite cold. She wore – like always – a skimpy mini skirt and was barefoot and she also wore just a tiny, totally backless top on her goosebumps. When greeting her, I could already feel her trembling body. On top of that, she had a severe cold again. Nevertheless, my son chose a table outside – so his girlfriend could smoke he said. So as we were sitting outside, me diagonally opposite from her, I noticed how slim she had become. Every single rib was visible, no gram of fat under her tanned goosebumps could keep her warm, so her quivering muscles tried doing that instead. She was almost shivering more intensely than in winter. When I gave her light for her cigarette, I had to hold her and asked: “Isn’t it too cold here for you? You have a bad cold.” I suggested going inside, but she replied: “As long as you two aren’t too cold, I’m gladly staying outside. I’m sure the cold will wear off soon.” Shortly, the waiter brought us some blankets and we used them to cover our legs. Expectantly, my son look at his girlfriend. In turn, she returned her blanket to the waiter telling him with chattering teeth and shining eyes: “Thank you, but that blanket would ruin my outfit.”</p>

<p>I’m sure she was very cold indeed, but you’re right: She relishes to occupy center stage. The waiter kept coming back to our table to enquire about our wishes and to light her cigarette, in the process of which her bare skin sometimes accidentally touched his hand. How is it with your girlfriend? Does she also enjoy the gaze and touch of strangers? Do you two hail from Germany, as well?</p>

<p>My son ordered his meal and asked his girlfriend if she would like a salad. She answered that she hadn’t eaten anything all day, which prompted him to tell the waiter: “That’s right, my girlfriend is on a diet. I’m sure she’s happy with her cigarettes.” But when my son was away for a second, my bad conscience surfaced again and I said: “You are already smoking way too much, please order a salad at least, I can already hear your stomach grumbling.” She just took my hand, placed it on her stomach, then on her trembling thigh and said: “Feel. Fat everywhere.” I replied: “No way, there is no fat on you, it’s all muscle! And please take a blanket, you’re freezing and have a terrible cold!” Her reply: “Yes, it’s quite cold. We’ve been outside all day in the rain, but you two like seeing me in sexy outfits, don’t you? This one was chosen by your son and for him I’m happily losing more weight. He’s into slender women. And so are you, right?”</p>

<p>What am I supposed to do? I find it sexy, too, of course, to see her so slim and so scantily dressed. But I can also see that’s it’s detrimental to her health. Is your girlfriend sick so often, too?</p>

<p>Hi. Also erkältet ist sie sehr selten. Zumindest nicht öfter als andere Menschen. Wenn sie was hat, dann sagt sie vielleicht manchmal kurz, dass ihr der Magen weh tut, wobei ich mir da nie sicher bin, ob das eine Ausrede für oder die Folge von ihrer Hungerei ist. Ansonsten ist sie ziemlich tough. Sie schränkt sich beim Essen zwar auch extrem ein und trainiert wie eine Irre, aber nachdem sie immer schon sehr dünn war und stolz auf ihre Figur ist und sie mir so natürlich am Besten gefällt, ist das für mich mehr als okay. Klar hab ich auch ein Auge drauf, dass sie nicht übertreibt. Umgekehrt ist es aber diese Mischung aus besorgt und fasziniert sein, die auch ihr wieder taugt und bei der Freundin deines Sohnes ist es wahrscheinlich genauso. Die bewundernden und eben auch besorgten Blicke der anderen machen sie schon happy. Was sie auch gern tut, ist andere Girls zu provozieren, speziell wenn deren Mann/Freund dabei ist. Wenn der Typ eh schon die ganze Zeit auf ihre Figur starrt, während seine bessere Hälfte eingemummelt da sitzt und sie dann zwar bibbernd aber auf cool erklärt, dass sie das ganze gern macht weil sie sexy sein will, dann find i das schon auch toll. Vor allem weil es halt meine Freundin ist und ich derjenige bin, der sie aufwärmen darf am Ende des Tages. Bin zwar kein Psychologe, aber ich bin mir trotzdem sicher, dass es für die beiden und auch für andere Girls, die so drauf sind, primär darum geht, dass sie sich und vor allem anderen beweisen, wie hart sie sind und dabei auch diese Mischung aus liebevoller Besorgnis und sexueller Bewunderung genießen. Ich würde mich gar nicht wundern, wenn sie das mittlerweile auch wegen dir macht, gerade WEIL du so besorgt bist. IMHO hat sie deine Hand deshalb auf ihren Bauch gelegt, damit du merkst wie hungrig sie ist und dass sie friert, hast sie dir sogar gesagt. Also sei ruhig weiter besorgt um sie, weil ihr das gut tut, aber hab kein schlechtes Gewissen weil sie das 1. freiwillig auf sich nimmt und 2. genießt. Meine Liebste war schon sehr schlank und drahtig wie wir uns kennen gelernt haben und ich stehe total auf diesen Typ Frau. Hab ich ihr auch so gesagt. Irgendwann habe ich bemerkt, dass sie noch dünner geworden ist und bin aus allen Wolken gefallen, weil sie das wegen mir gemacht hat. Für sie war das so eine Art Liebesbeweis: Habe das zwar nicht von ihr erwartet, war deshalb aber trotzdem komplett hingerissen und letztlich war das auch der Grund warum ich fix mit ihr zusammen bin. Bin $%!@ und unsportlich und hätte das andersrum nie gemacht und hatte auch anfangs deshalb ein schlechtes Gewissen, weil sie eben viel für ihre Figur tut und auch oft hungrig ist. Ich versteh auch, dass du ein schlechtes Gewissen hast, wenn ihr kalt ist. Find es selber auch manchmal gemein, wenn ich gut eingepackt in Winterklamotten da sitze und meine zarte Elfe mit Minirock und nacktem Bauch zitternd vor mir steht. Aber nochmal: niemand zwingt die beiden dazu und ich schätze mal, dass das Gefühl, dafür bewundert und begehrt zu werden für die beiden das mehr als wett macht.  Dass die Freundin deines Sohnes hungrig geblieben ist und frierend neben dir gesessen ist und selbst der Kellner gemerkt hat, wie tapfer sie ist, hat ihr sicher einen Kick gegeben, der die Quälerei wert war. Und dass du ihr gesagt hast, dass sie kein Fett hat und du hörst, dass ihr vor Hunger der Magen knurrt und dass du siehst wie schrecklich kalt ihr ist, war das Zähneklappern sicher wert. LG aus der Schweiz</p>

<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hi. Well, she only very rarely gets a cold. At least not more often than other people. If there is anything, it’s that she sometimes says that her stomach hurts. But I’m never really sure if that’s an excuse for her starving herself or the result of it. Apart from that, she’s pretty tough. Admittedly, she does limit herself with eating extremely and she works out like a madwoman, but since she has always been very thin and is proud of her figure and since I naturally like her best this way, that’s more than alright with me. Of course, I still keep a wary eye on her to make sure that she does not overboard. Contrariwise, it is this mixture of being concerned and fascinated which delights her and it’s probably the same with your son’s girlfriend. The admiring but at the same time worrying glances of others do indeed give her delight.</p>

<p>Another thing she likes to do is to provoke other girls, especially when they are with their husband/boyfriend. When that guy is already staring at her figure the whole time as his significant other is sitting there wrapped in thick clothes and she declares while shivering but keeping her cool that she enjoys it that way for the sake of being sexy, then I do really like that. Especially because it’s my girlfriend and I am the one who may warm her up at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I’m not a psychologist, but I’m still sure that these two and also other girls like them primarily want to prove to themselves and even more so to others how tough they are and they also enjoy this mixture of loving concern and sexual admiration. I wouldn’t be surprised if your son’s girlfriend does it by now also because of you, exactly BECAUSE you are so concerned. IMHO she placed your hand on her stomach for you to notice how hungry she is. And you even told her that she was freezing. So, just continue worrying about her because (1) she bears this by her own choice and (2) she enjoys it.</p>

<p>My sweetheart has already been very slim and wiry when we met and I’m totally into that type of girl. And I also told her that. Eventually, I noticed that she had become even thinner and I was flabbergasted when I learned that she had done that for my sake. For her, it was a type of proof of love. Even though I had not expected that of her, I was completely enraptured and in the end that’s also the reason why we quickly got together. I am not athletic and would not have done that in her place at all, and I also had a bad conscience in the beginning because she works hard for her figure and is often hungry. I also understand that you have a bad conscience when she is cold. I also find it mean sometimes when I am sitting there well wrapped up in my winter clothes while my wispy fairy is standing in front of me shivering in a mini skirt and with a naked midriff. But again: Nobody forces them to do it and I reckon, the feeling of being admired and desired more than makes it up for them. Certainly, your son’s girlfriend got such a kick out of staying hungry and sitting next to you freezing while even the waiter had noticed how tough she is, that it was worth the ordeal. And you telling her that there is not fat on her, how you can hear stomach grumbling from hunger and that you can see how terribly cold she must be, certainly was worth the chattering of her teeth.</p>

<p>Greetings from Switzerland.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I have been watching this thread for years now, but I never created an account until now. But now I thought: Why not join in with the recent activity? I'm also a guy who loves a brave shivering girl. Sadly I have no exciting experiences of my own to contribute. I'm also from Germany, so I will write something in German and maybe translate it then, let's see.</p>

<p>Martin und Iceman, ich beneide euch so sehr um so tapfere Freundinnen! Ich hatte auch schon eine sehr schlanke Freundin, aber noch nie ein Mädchen, das solche Kältetorturen mitgemacht hätte. Bitte erzählt noch mehr Geschichten davon! Martin, wie alt sind z. B. dein Sohn und seine Freundin?</p>

<p>Für mich die idealen Eigenschaften eines Mädels sind Stolz, Perfektionismus und Disziplin. Solch ein Mädel will immer die Schönste sein und versucht immer, ihre Erscheinung noch zu optimieren. Dazu gehört es natürlich auch, schlank und top durchtrainiert zu sein, und ihre Figur dann auch zur Schau zu stellen, egal wie das Wetter sein mag. Nichts macht ein Mädchen für mich attraktiver, als wenn ersichtlich ist, dass sie für ihr tadelloses Äußeres gerne Opfer bringt.</p>

<p>Eine schlanke Figur und kaltes Winterwetter spielen da natürlich wunderbar zusammen, weil sie gerne inkaufnimmt, noch mehr zu frieren, wenn sie ihren überflüssigen Speck noch verliert und dennoch auch bei Schneetreiben nur ein leichtes Sommerkleidchen trägt. Es gefällt mir auch sehr, wenn sie auch bei schwierigen Bedingungen wie längeren Ausflügen oder auf eisigem Kopfsteinpflaster High Heels trägt. Das ergänzt sich wiederum auch mit einer schlanken Figur, denn ihre ranken Beine erscheinen so noch schmaler. Und es ist natürlich nur einem Mädchen mit einer grazilen Figur möglich, wirklich lange auf solchen Schuhen zu laufen.</p>

<p>Martin, ich denke Iceman hat schon viele plausible Gedanken zur Freundin deines Sohnes angestellt. Ich will noch hinzufügen, dass dein Sohn und du vemutlich ein tolles Team abgebt, um für seine Freundin und auch für euch das meiste aus eurem kleinen Spielchen herauszuholen. Dein Sohn mag seine Freundin zwar hart antreiben, aber letztlich ist es wohl schon sie, die das Ganze so will. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass sie im Privaten mit deinem Sohn ihm für sein hartes Auftreten dankt und ihn ermuntert, sie weiter so zu unterstützen. Denn dass sie bereit ist, selbst qualvoll lange Zeit mit zitternden Gliedern in der Kälte auszuharren, zeigt ja, wie wichtig es ihr ist, immer das schönste und tapferste Mädchen zu sein. Während dein Sohn ihr also hilft, nicht einzuknicken, gibst du ihr die Bestätigung, nach der sie sich sehnt, indem du eben gar nicht glauben kannst, welches Leid sie für die Schönheit auf sich nimmt.</p>

<p>Also, genau wie Iceman es gesagt hat, macht nur weiter so. Dein Sohn darf sie ruhig weiter antreiben und du kannst ihr ruhig oft sagen, dass du dich um sie sorgst. Vielleicht kannst du aber zwischendurch auch etwas sticheln, z. B. wenn du siehst, wie sie mal ein Top anzieht, das ihren Bauchnabel bedeckt. Da könntest du sie sozusagen "ertappen" und sagen: "Oh, dir ist es heute wohl doch zu kalt für ein leichteres Top? Ich bin froh, dass du zur Vernunft kommst." Ich bin sicher, du kannst gar nicht so schnell schauen, wie das Top wieder in der Ecke liegt ;-)</p>

<p>Und dass du hoffst, dass ihr Freund ihr im kommenden Winter öfter eine Jacke erlaubt, kann ich nicht verstehen. Sie hat den Winter doch heil überstanden und anscheinend ja nicht oft eine Jacke getragen. Darauf ist sie sicher super stolz und das auch zurecht! Wenn sie jetzt einknicken würde und regelmäßig eine Jacke trüge, wäre doch der ganze Zauber dahin oder findest du nicht? Klar, ich verstehe schon, dass du dir Sorgen machst, weil sie oft erkältet ist, aber so ist das im Leben eben: Man kann nicht alles haben und ich bin sicher, die Erkältungen nimmt sie für die Schönheit gerne inkauf. Genau, worum es ja in dem Thema hier geht.</p>

<p>Und dass sie schon in einer frischen Sommernacht eine Decke ihr Outfit ruinieren lassen würde, hast du doch selbst nicht geglaubt oder ;-)</p>

<p>Zuletzt will ich noch auf die Figurfrage zu sprechen kommen. Du schreibst, sie wiegt 52 kg bei 1,75 m. Das ist zwar einigermaßen schlank, aber da kann ich auch gut verstehen, dass sie deine Hand auf ihren Bauch und ihre Schenkel legt, um dir zu zeigen, dass trotzdem noch etwas zu viel an ihr dran ist. Männer sind da ja oft ein wenig nachsichtiger, während gerade so perfektionistische Mädchen, wie sie ja eines zu sein scheint, genauer hinschauen. Und von dem Gewicht ist es schon noch ein kleines Stückchen bis zu einer Figur, die z. B. ich, aber eben auch viele Mädchen, als ideal empfinden. Ich würde sogar so weit gehen, zu sagen, dass sie noch etwa 10 kg abnehmen kann, bis sie perfekt ist. Du kannst sie ja mal fragen, was ihr Wunschgewicht so ist. Klar ist auch, dass sie mit einem schlankeren Körper dann auch im Winter mehr kämpfen muss, um in der Kälte ihre knappen Outfits zu präsentieren. Aber die Motivation durchzuhalten ist sicher auch nochmal größer, wenn sie weiß, dass kein Gramm zu viel mehr an ihr dran ist.</p>

<p>Iceman und Martin, mich würde auch interessieren, wie euer sonstiges soziales Umfeld auf die Mädels reagiert. Lechzen die männlichen Freunde nicht alle eure tapferen Schneeprinzessinnen an? Und das muss doch deren Freundinnen total irre machen. Du hast schon was dazu geschrieben, Iceman, aber wenn du noch ausführen magst, wäre das toll.</p>

<p>Ich freue mich auf eure Meinungen und vor allem weitere Berichte!</p>

<div class="translation">Translation:<br><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I have been watching this thread for years now, but I never created an account until now. But now I thought: Why not join in with the recent activity? I'm also a guy who loves a brave shivering girl. Sadly I have no exciting experiences of my own to contribute. I'm also from Germany, so I will write something in German and maybe translate it then, let's see.</p>

<p>Martin and Iceman, I envy you so much for your brave girlfriends! I also had a very slender girlfriend once, but never a girl that would have borne such torments of cold. Please relate more stories about it! Martin, how old are your son and his girlfriend, for example?</p>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, the ideal features of a girl are pride, perfectionism and discipline. Such a girl will always want to be the most beautiful and she will always try to optimize her appearance. Naturally, part of that is being slender and perfectly toned, and also showing off her figure regardless of what the weather might be. Nothing makes a girl more attractive to me than when it is obvious that she gladly makes sacrifices for her flawless appearance.</p>

<p>A lithe figure and cold winter weather of course play together very well for this, because she will readily accept freezing even more, when she has lost the remaining fat and still only wears a flimsys summer dress in the scurrying snow. I also really like when she wears high heels even in adverse conditions like on longer trips or on icy cobble stone. That and a slender figure complement each other very well, for her slender legs seem even slimmer that way. And of course only a girl with a graceful figure can keep walking on such shoes for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Martin, I think Icemand has already reflected quite well about your son’s girlfriend. I would like to add that you and your son are probably making a great team for getting the most out of your little game for his girlfriend and also for you two. Your son may indeed be fiercely pushing his girlfriend, but in the end it seems like it is really her who wants it like this. I can imagine that she thanks your son in private for his harsh demeanor and encourages him to continue supporting her like this. For her readiness to stay out in the cold even for a torturously long time with shivering limbs shows how important it is to her to always be the fairest and toughest girl. So, while your son is helping her not to give in, your are giving her the validation that she yearns for by how you cannot believe the suffering she endures for beauty.</p>

<p>So, it’s just like Iceman said: Just keep doing what you’re doing. Your son can keep pushing her and you can keep telling her that you are worrying for her. But maybe you can also tease her a little sometimes. E.g. when you see her putting on a top covering her navel, you could ‘catch’ her at it and say: “O, so today it’s too cold for you to wear a lighter top? I’m glad you’re coming to your senses.” I’m sure you can’t even look as fast as that top will lie in the corner again.</p>

<p>And I fail to understand that you hope that your son will allow her a jacket more often next winter. She came through last winter unscathed without often wearing a jacket, right? I’m sure she’s super proud of that and rightly so! If she gave in now and regularly wore a jacket, all the magic would be gone or don’t you think so? Of course I understand that you are concerned because she is sick so often, but that’s how it is in life: You can’t have everything and I’m sure she gladly accepts having a cold for the sake of beauty. Exactly what this topic is all about.</p>

<p>And that she would let a blanket ruin her outfit in just a nippy summer night? You didn’t really believe that, did you?</p>

<p>Finally, I want to come to the question of her figure. You wrote that she weighs 52 kg at 1.75 m. That may be somewhat slim, but I can definitely understand that she places your hand on her stomach and thighs to show you that she does have something left to lose. Oftentimes, men are a a little more lenient with this, but especially perfectionist girls – like she seems to be – are more stern. And from that weight there is indeed still some way to go to the figure deemed ideal by e.g. me, but also by many girls. I would even go so far as to say that she could lose about 10 kg until she is perfect. Why don’t you ask her about her goal weight some time? It is also clear that a slimmer body would also mean a tougher struggle in order to show off her skimpy outfits in the cold. But the motivation to push through will certainly be all the greater seeing as she will know that she has no gram too much on her, any more.</p>

<p>Iceman and Martin, I would also like to know how your family and friends react to the girls. Aren’t all your male friends panting for your brave snow princesses? That has to drive their girlfriends totally crazy, doesn’t it? You already wrote a little about that, Iceman, but it would be great if you could elaborate a little more on that.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to your opinions and especially to further reports!</p>

<p>Oh and I would love to hear more from our frosty girls, too! Especially from Lissy. Are you still around, because you are a legend to me; I cannot stop reading your stories! I would love to hear if you are still so superstrict with yourself? Are you still only wearing a minimum of clothes and have you maintained your stellar figure?</p>

<p>Or have you let yourself go a little? :-(</p>

<p>Hallo beauty.takes.sacrifice,
danke für deine ausführliche Antwort. Ja die Freundin von meinem Sohn zeigt mit Stolz ihren Körper und ich denke auch das sie eine Perfektionistin ist. Ich bewundere sie unglaublich, mit welcher Disziplin sie ihre Erscheinung optimiert, wie du es treffend beschrieben hast. Sie hat in letzter Zeit noch weiter abgenommen und trainiert täglich, um jegliches Fett zu verbrennen, da sie weiter der Meinung ist, zu $%!@ zu sein. Aber das stimmt natürlich nicht. Sie hat eine Hammerfigur und zeigt diese auch gern. Ich kenne ihr genaues Gewicht nicht, aber ich denke, dass sie in der Zwischenzeit unter 50kg wiegt. Ich habe letztes Wochenende meinen Sohn und seine Freundin darauf angesprochen, dass sie ihre Diät und ihr Training übertreibt. Wir waren zwei Tage zusammen und sie hat den ganzen Tag nur Kaffee getrunken und am Abend einen Salat gegessen und wirklich viel zu viel geraucht. Mein Sohn meinte ich solle sie nicht immer bevormunden und ihr ihre Zigaretten lassen. Ihm gefallen schließlich schlanke Mädchen am besten. Sie beruhigte mich, dass sie nicht übertreibt und sich viel wohler fühlt, seit sie abnimmt und sie für uns Männer gern noch ein paar Kilo verlieren möchte. Bevor ich antworten konnte, fragte sie mich gleich nach der nächsten Zigarette. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich auch rauche, aber lange nicht so viel, wie sie.  Mein Sohn ist 19 und seine Freundin schon 26. Den Altersunterschied kannte er aber anfangs nicht. Sie hat mir zuerst ihr Alter verraten und gemeint, dass sie total in ihn verliebt ist und er sie verlassen wird, wenn er ihr Alter erfährt. Ich mache mir auch deshalb so viele Gedanken, weil ich ihr damals anvertraut habe, dass mein Sohn auf schlanke Frauen in knappen Klamotten steht.
Ich denke auch daher kommt ihre Disziplin und ihr Ehrgeiz immer besser auszusehen, als die jüngeren Frauen und auch eine gewisse Vertrautheit zu mir.
Nun zu deinen weiteren Fragen. Nein, ich war nicht wirklich überrascht, dass sie die Decke abgelehnt hat und ehrlich gesagt geniesse ich es auch neben so einer attraktiven Frau zu sitzen und ihre Gänsehaut fühlen zu dürfen.
Zu der Jackenfrage im Winter bin ich hin und her gerissen. Auf der einen Seite ist es unglaublich sexy und aufregend sie mit soviel nackter Haut im Winter zu sehen und zu erleben, wie sie der Kälte widersteht. Andererseits erlebe ich, wie oft sie krank ist und trotzdem ohne Jacke in der Kälte aushalten muss, weil mein Sohn ihr keine Möglichkeit gibt, sich wenigstens zwischendurch mal aufzuwärmen. Er treibt sie dann schon an durchzuhalten. Ich habe sie in solchen Situationen schon erlebt. Wenn die Freundinnen seiner Freunde im Winter zum Aufbruch drängen, weil sie in dicker Winterkleidung frieren , bei ihr aber von winterlicher Kleidung keine Andeutung zu erkennen ist, sie in seinem Arm in ihrem Minirock und Top unvorstellbar zittert, hustet, niest und ihre Zigarette nicht mehr halten kann, streicht er über ihre Gänsehaut und fragt seine Freundin: Wir können doch noch bleiben oder wird dir es auch zu kalt? Sie kann dann nicht anders und sagt mit klappernden Zähnen: Wir können solange bleiben, wie du möchtest, wenn ich bei dir sein kann ist es mir noch nie zu kalt geworden</p>

<p>Hi, beauty.takes.sacrifice !</p>

<p>Also das mit dem Perfektionismus stimmt bei meiner 100pro. Zu meinem Glück bezieht sich dieser Perfektionismus zwar nur auf sie selber und nicht zB auf mich, aber so sanft und verständnisvoll sie bei mir und anderen ist, so unnachgiebig ist sie bei sich selbst und "beauty takes sacrifice" ist eben ein Aspekt dieses Perfektionismus. Klar gibt es durchschnittlich schlanke Mädels die kaum Sport machen und essen, was ihnen schmeckt, aber 1. sind das nur wenige und 2. ist es leider keine Frage des Wunschdenkens, sondern der Physiologie, dass eine fast fettlose, durchtrainierte Figur eiserne Disziplin erfordert. 
Und natürlich kann ein Mädchen mit Winterjacke, Pullover, Schal etc. auch hübsch aussehen, aber ... wenn mir (speziell hier in diesem Forum) irgendwer erzählt, dass das genauso sexy ist, wie lange, sehnige Beine mit Mini, ein eingesunkener, zitternder Waschbrettbauch und ein bauchfreies, ärmelloses und rückenfreies Top auf leicht gebräunter Gänsehaut ist, dann lösche ich sofort wieder meinen Account ;-).</p>

<p>Im Ernst: ich würde nie von ihr verlangen, dass sie das tut, weil ich es umgekehrt auch nicht tun würde und sie ist auch das erste Mädel, dass so tough ist und ich bewundere sie nicht nur für das Resultat ihrer Quälerei = ihr Aussehen, sondern auch dafür, dass sie so tapfer ist. Andererseits hab ich mich darum auch heillos in sie verknallt. Natürlich find ich ihren Körper einfach wunderschön, aber ich finde es umgekehrt genauso anturnend, dass sie dafür so leidet. Und dass sie letztlich für mich diese Torturen auf sich nimmt ... ja, es ist geil.</p>

<p>Hab es eh schon geschrieben: ich versteh, dass Martin ein schlechtes Gewissen hat. Hab' ich auch manchmal. Sie war immer schon sehr schlank und sportlich, aber damit sie wirklich einen so geringen Körperfettanteil hat und so extrem definiert ist, dass man(n) jede Muskelfaser unter ihrer Haut siehst, dafür hungert sie. Und dass sie, gerade weil sie so eine zarte, ausgehungerte Elfe ist, besonders leicht friert ist auch eine Tatsache. Die Kehrseite der Medaille ist, dass sie von mir und ihrer Umgebung in ihrem Perfektionismus bestätigt wird und jeder sie bewundert - ich und andere auch. </p>

<p>Wir haben mit einem befreundetem Paar Silvester gefeiert: Da ich ursprünglich aus Österreich komme und jetzt in der Schweiz arbeite, sind wir nach Wien in ein schickes Hotel gefahren. Meine Liebste hatte sich nicht einmal zu Weihnachten von Ihrer strikten Diät und ihrem harten Trainingsplan abhalten lassen und war natürlich jetzt mächtig stolz darauf, dass sie im Unterschied zu jedem anderen nicht zugenommen hatte, sondern durch den Weihnachts-Stress sogar noch dünner geworden war. Sie hatte sich für diesen Event ein schwarzes Minikleidchen gekauft. Dieses war rückenfrei und das Oberteil war nur mit einer schmalen Stoffbrücke mit dem Rock verbunden und natürlich hat man ihre Rippen und den Bauch gesehen. Die Verlobte meines Freundes ist ein durchaus hübsches Mädchen aber eben etwas kurvig und obwohl es in dem Saal ohnedies nicht wirklich kalt war, hatte sie einen weißen Hosenanzug mit Jacke und einen schwarzen Rollkragenpullover an. Da wir in dem Hotel gewohnt haben, wo das Dinner war, fror meine Freundin zwar noch kaum, aber einen leichten Anflug von Gänsehaut durch die Zugluft eines geöffneten Fensters hatte sie dennoch, was ihr weibliches Gegenüber sofort zur spitzen Bemerkung verleitete, dass ihr mit etwas "mehr Stoff, nicht so kalt wäre". Mein Freund war definitiv nicht dieser Meinung: Bereits bei unserer Begrüßung umarmte er meine Liebste so innig, dass ich ihm - wäre er nicht mein bester Freund - eine gescheuert hätte und während ich verzweifelt bemüht war, small talk mit seiner Verlobten zu führen, war er nur damit beschäftigt, die Figur meiner Liebsten anzuhimmeln und sich nach ihrem Ernährungs- und Trainingsplan zu erkundigen, was seine Verlobte wiederum zu zunehmend bissigen Bemerkungen anstachelte, dass sie viel zu dünn sei und ständig krank sein müsste und warum sie nur ein bisschen Salat gegessen hat, obwohl das Dinner doch so vorzüglich war und warum sie vegan isst und ... ich war echt erleichtert, dass es sich langsam Mitternacht näherte. Während sich die Mädels frisch machten, warteten mein Freund und ich auf der Dachterrasse des Hotels und natürlich redete er ... von der perfekten Figur meiner Freundin und wie heiß sie sei und wie viel Glück ich habe (was ich ja weiß). Wenn ich ihn nicht gestoppt hätte, hätte er noch weiter geredet, selbst als seine Verlobte, die mittlerweile, wie wir zwei Männer auch, in einen langen Wintermantel gewickelt war, zu uns auf die Terrasse kam. "Ach, deine Freundin kommt wohl nicht. Die friert sicher trotz Mantel zu sehr hier heroben, so mager wie die ist." Wie auf's Stichwort stakste meine Göttin, nur mit ihrem sexy Minikleidchen auf die Dachterrasse. Sie versuchte, ihr Zittern tapfer zu unterdrücken und lehnte sich betont lässig auf das Geländer. "Klar ist mir eiskalt, aber ich hab für meinen Minisixpack hart trainiert und mein Liebster soll als erstes im Neuen Jahr seine sexy Freundin spüren und nicht einen Lodenmantel." Mein Freund schnappte mehrmals nach Luft und sein Blick in meine Richtung verriet wie sehr er mich im Moment beneidete. "Wärmst du mich, wenn ich zu sehr friere, mein Großer ?" Sie warf mir fröstelnd und mit klappernden Zähnen ein sexy Lächeln zu und ich sah am Leuchten in ihren schönen, dunklen Augen, wie sehr sie es genoss, dass wir ihre Tapferkeit bewunderten. Ich hab meinen Handschuh ausgezogen und streichelte mit meiner warmen Hand über ihren nackten Rücken. Obwohl mein Freund mittlerweile wie ein Ertrinkender seine Verlobte umklammerte, konnte er seine Augen nicht von meiner Freundin lassen, die mittlerweile vor Kälte bibberte aber noch immer mit ausgebreiteten Armen am Geländer lehnte. Ich hätte zwar stundenlang ihren zitternden, gänsehautübersäaten Körper bewundern können, aber ich habe dann schließlich meinen Mantel aufgeknöpft und sie hat sich an mich gekuschelt. Sogar ihre Bauchmuskeln haben gezittert und ja, das erste was ich im neuen Jahr gespürt habe war kein Lodenmantel sondern ihre Gänsehaut. Ich hab sie dann irgendwann geschnappt, ins Zimmer zurück getragen ... ich hätte mit meinem Freund oder sonst jemand nicht tauschen wollen, auch wenn das meine letzte Nacht auf der Welt gewesen wäre. Ich weiß, dass das wie ein Kitschroman klingt, aber ich mein das so. Sie ist die tapferste und die schönste und das sag ich ihr auch und ich geb auch zu, dass ich dankbar bin, dass ich so jemand gefunden hab.</p>

<p>bassdrummer, ich hab halt leider wirklich keine erwähnenswerten Erfahrungen mit frierenden Mädchen. Meine bisherigen Freundinnen (sind auch noch nicht so viele) haben so etwas immer komplett abgeblockt und ich habe es dann auch nicht so wirklich verfolgt. Ich habe einige frei erfundene Geschichten, die davon handeln. Wenn sie euch interessieren, schreibe ich sie gerne. Bisher hatte ich nur den Eindruck, dass die Leute hier nichts auf erfundene Geschichten geben - auch wenn sicherlich nicht alles wahr ist, was hier geschrieben wurde.</p>

<p>Echte Erfahrungen habe ich mit einer sehr schlanken Freundin, die auch ab und zu gerne angespornt wurde, aber das ist ja hier eher ein Nebenthema; wenn es interessiert, teile ich es natürlich gerne. Oder ich mache ein eigenes Thema dazu. Ich finde es übrigens interessant (und toll!), dass hier ein Konsens zu bestehen scheint, dass superschlanke Mädchen am schönsten sind.</p>

<p>Martin, super, dass die Freundin deines Sohnes (wie heißt sie eigentlich?) noch ein bisschen mehr abgenommen hat. Du kannst ihr ja bei Gelegenheit ja mal ein Kompliment dafür aussprechen und fragen, was sie derzeit so wiegt und was ihr Ziel ist. Würde mich einfach interessieren.</p>

<p>Aber ich muss zugeben, sie scheint sich derzeit echt nichts zu gönnen, wenn sie an zwei Tagen nur zwei Salate gegessen hat. Ich hoffe auch, sie schafft es, ein bisschen weniger zu rauchen. Ohne die appetithemmende Wirkung muss sie sich vermutlich zwar noch mehr beherrschen, um ihre strenge Diät einzuhalten, aber ich denke, wenn sie es nur will, schafft sie das auch.</p>

<p>Die Info zu dem Altersunterschied ist aber sehr interessant. Und jetzt verstehe ich auch deine Sorgen besser, denn wenn ich es richtig verstehe, gibst du dir die Schuld daran, dass sie jetzt so hungert und friert, weil du ihr die Vorlieben deines Sohnes verraten hast? Das klingt schon plausibel, aber ich bin sicher, das hätte sie auch alleine noch spitz gekriegt, denn dein Sohn scheint ja nicht gerade zu verbergen, dass er sie gerne für ihn leiden sieht. Ich würde es an deiner Stelle jetzt einfach genießen, solange es währt. Ich hoffe, sie wird noch lange so streng mit sich bleiben. Schade, dass es mit dem Wetter derzeit unmöglich ist zu frieren, aber versprich uns, dass du uns im Winter schilderst, wie sie sich schlägt!</p>

<p>Iceman, vielen Dank für die kleine Erzählung, deine Freundin macht mich so richtig an. Ich würde genauso wie euer Freund an Silvester nur noch sie anhimmeln und meine eigene Begleitung darüber vermutlich völlig vergessen. Was mich am verrücktesten macht, ist, wie offensiv sie mit ihrer Situation umgeht: Sie gibt offen zu, dass sie fürchterlich friert und auch dass ihre Figur nicht von ungefähr kommt. Und auf die Weise gibt sie ja auch preis, dass sie in Wahrheit herabblickt auf langweilige Frauen, die sich nicht so im Griff haben wie sie. Ich muss sagen, dass ich so eine Arroganz schon sexy finde.</p>

<p>Du schreibst, dass auch ihr Umfeld sie für ihre eiserne Disziplin und ihre Spitzenfigur bewundert. Sind das dann hauptsächlich Männer? Denn ich kann mir vorstellen, dass die meisten Frauen darauf eher ablehnend reagieren würde, wie z. B. die eifersüchtige Begleitung von deinem Freund. Oder gibt es auch welche, die sie bewundern oder ihr sogar nacheifern?</p>

<p>Wenn ich so fantasiere, vergesse ich fast, dass sie trotz allem auch nur ein Mensch ist und sicher auch manchmal an ihre Grenzen kommt, sei es dass sie mal doch der Heißhunger überkommt und sie mehr isst, als sie sollte, oder dass sie sich an einem kalten Winterausflug mal überschätzt und doch zu sehr friert. Kommt das vor? Wie reagiert sie dann? Ich denke an Situationen wie eine Winterwanderung oder so etwas, bei der sie die einzige ist, die mit Minirock und knappem Top unterwegs ist. Wenn die Wanderung dann kälter oder länger wird, als sie dachte und sie ihren grazilen Körper - abgesehen von unerbittlichem Zittern - kaum noch bewegen kann, dann muss sie sich ja zwangsläufig etwas aufwärmen. Ist ihr das dann peinlich oder ist sie sogar wütend auf sich? Wäre schön, wenn du dazu was sagen kannst. Eine ähnliche Situation wäre z. B., wenn sie mal ein, zwei Kilo zugenommen hat, was ja vielleicht auch mal vorkommt. Würde mich einfach interessieren, was  es mit so einem eigentlich perfekten Mädchen macht, wenn sie doch mal schlappmacht.</p>

<p>By the way, are there still many people around who don't speak German? Not sure if we should switch back to English.</p>

<p>And here is a recent picture of the beautiful Kate Kusmina in a bikini at night:</p>

<p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0MMJlkIIhg/</p>

<p>https://imgur.com/1o4W004</p>

<p>I'm posting this because she described the situation like this (automatic translation):
"I don't know, guys, what could be better than pizza in the open air next to the pool !! mild summer rain and cold water combined with delicious food work wonders! I really like the feeling of cold when your teeth are chattering, but you do not feel psychologically any coolness and you are ready to swim again and again, although you are almost shaken by a shiver :)) I experienced it for the first time and it is very strange and cool !! Marina told me that I should rather run home, because (probably?) I was too aware that my body was dying of cold, but I myself didn't feel it at all !!"</p>

<p>Sounds like she likes to shiver! What a cool girl!</p>

<p>By the way, I find it a pain to find anything in this huge thread and it messes up all non-ascii characters pretty badly (This is not just for me right? German text is nigh-unreadable.) So I made my own version of it a long time ago. I just published it, in case someone is interested:</p>

<p>But beware. It's one big site. Good to search in your home computer browser, but not friendly to your mobile data. It's also missing some comments that had been deleted at the time I created it such as shiverfan's stories apparently. At least that's what I can gather from the content of some comments.</p>

<p>There's also a version with more neutral colors:</p>

<p>beauty.takes.sacrifice: echte Geschichten sind immer besser. Was hast du denn da für eine Story von einer Freundin die gerne angespornt wurde?</p>

<p>Deine unteren Links funktionieren leider nicht.</p>

<p>Iceman: Tolle Freundin, es ist schön das ihr was gefunden habt, was euch beide anmacht, gibt es selten. </p>

<p>Daher suche ich immer Videos, in denen man zitternde Frauen sieht, mittlerweile habe ich viele davon und eines sogar selbst gedreht, gern kann ich davon erzählen, wenn ihr möchtet. </p>

<p>Zur Geschichte mit dem Mädel.....</p>

<p>ich habe sie in besagtem Forum angeschrieben und ihr mein Vorhaben erklärt, völlig überraachend willigte sie ein. </p>

<p>Sie wohnt in der Nähe von Hamburg und wir haben uns auf einem Parkplatz getroffen, es war an diesem Tage zwar Winter, aber leider nicht so wirklich kalt, aus diesem Grund habe ich einige Flaschen mit Wasser mitgenommen um ihre Kleidung nass machen zu können. 
Sie hatte eine weiße, dünne Bluse an, eine Jeans-Hotpans und eine Strumpfhose drunter, Wir sind in einen Wald gefahren, dort konnten wir sicher sein in Ruhe filmen zu können. Wir haben schnell gemerkt, dass es ohne Wasser kein gutes Video werden würde, sie hat also eine Flasche aufgemacht, mich ziemlich sexy angelächet und es sich dann langsam über die Schultern laufen lassen, so dass sie von oben bs unten nass wurde. Nun ging es schnell mit dem zittern und sie sagte mit einem lächeln "ist es das, was du sehen wolltest?"
Natürlich war es das und sie machte es gut, konnte ruhig stehen bleiben und das Zittern über sicher ergehen lassen, irgenwann nahm sie von sich aus die nächste Flasche, legte sich auf den Boden und schüttete sie über Ihren Körper aus. Das Zittern wurde immer stärker und ich fragte schon, ob wir mal eine Pause machen wollen, sie entgegnete aber "nein, es macht mir nichts zu frieren", also machten wir weiter... Ca. eine Stunde konnte ich so drehen.... Zum Schluss gingen wir wieder zu den Autos, sie hatte wieder eine Jacke an und wir rauchten noch eine, dann plötzlich wurde ihr so richtig kalt und sie saß zitternd auf dem Fahrersitz und zog an ihrer Zigarette. "Ein geiler Abschluss, oder" sagte sie lächelnd und fuhr nach Hause. Natürlich habe ich diesen letzten Part auch gefilmt. :-)</p>

<p>Hoffe es gefällt ein wenig. :-)</p>

<p>Gut, dann trage ich auch etwas bei:
Ich war Student, arbeitete aber nebenbei und verdiente ganz gut Geld. Meine Freundin war noch in der Ausbildung. Weil sie aber eine Vorliebe für sehr gute Kleidung hatte, aber nicht genug Geld dafür, schossen wir einen Deal ab. Ich würde ihr monatlich eine gewisse Summe geben und sie würde sich im Gegenzug einmal pro Woche so kleiden, wie ich es mochte. Sie wusste, worauf sie sich einließ, denn sie kannte meine Vorliebe für dünne Kleidung im Winter.
Ich habe in der Folgezeit viel erlebt. Eines von vielen Beispielen:</p>

<p>Wir wollten eine kalte Aktion im Wald machen. Sie zog sich dazu einen extrem kurzen Mini an. Es war ein Tennisrock, den wir so kurz machten, dass er gerade eben über den Po ging. Darunter trug sie nichts. Dazu nähte sie sich eine völlig durchsichtige Bluse. Weil sie einen sehr kleinen Busen hatte, trug sie keine BHs. Ich füllte einen Kanister mit eiskaltem Wasser und wir fuhren los.
An einer recht einsamen Stelle bogen wir auf einen Waldweg. Es lag ca. 10 cm Schnee und die Temperaturen waren unter 0 Grad. Ich schnappte den Kanister und wir liefen ca. 5 Minuten, bis wir tiefer im Wald waren. Sie durfte nichts zum Überziehen mitnehmen.
Wir fühlten uns unbeobachtet und ich machte meine Kamera bereit. Dann goss ich den ersten Schwall kaltes Wasser über ihre Schultern. Die Bluse wurde völlig durchsichtig und klebte an der Haut. Es schauderte sie. Sie lief ein wenig hin und her und fing an zu zittern. Ich merkte, wie es mir hinter der Kamera eher warm wude. Weil im Kanister noch viel Wasser war, kippte ich den zweiten Schwall über ihren Körper. Ihre Haut war jetzt schon ganz rot und ihre Zähne klapperten. Sie krampfte die Hände ineinander um nicht am ganze Körper zu zittern. 
Noch immer war der Wasservorrat nicht zu Ende. Ein weiterer Schwall brachte sie nun wirklich an den Rand ihrer Möglichkeiten. Sie konnte nichts mehr sagen und bibberte. Jetzt musste sie noch den Weg zum Auto antreten. Als wir uns umdrehten, sahen wir, dass wir einen Zuschauer hatten. Als wir ihn ansahen, drehte er um und ging weg. 
Erst am Auto durfte sich meine Freundin abtrocken und umziehen - natürlich draußen. Als Kleidung lagen ein weiterer Micromini und eine andere durchsichtige Bluse bereit, Strümpfe und Schuhe - mehr nicht.  </p>

<p>Ist nichts Besonderes, nur ne lesbarere Version des Threads, die ich für mich gemacht habe und dachte, vielleicht interessiert sich jemand dafür.</p>

<p>Deine Geschichte klingt echt super, bassdrummer! Toll, dass sie das gemacht hat und sie scheint ja auch richtig reingefunden zu haben, wenn sie sogar selbst noch Wasser über sich geschüttet hat. Und eine Stunde ist schon gar nicht so wenig! Sah sie denn auch gut aus?</p>

<p>franz_net, auch deine Erfahrung ist toll zu lesen. Echt heiß, der Deal, dass du ihr Kleider kaufst und sie dafür dann regelmäßig anziehen muss, was du ihr vorgibst. Du scheinst sie mit der Waldaktion ja richtig an ihre Grenzen gebracht zu haben. Hat sie das auch ein bisschen gemocht oder nur durchgestanden, um an ihre stylischen Klamotten zu kommen? Und darf ich fragen, was sie zu dem Anlass für Schuhe getragen hat?</p>

<p>Teilt ihr eure Videos auch, bassdrummer und franz_net? Wenn ja, wo?</p>

<p>Hier sind übrigens ein paar Bilder von einem leicht bekleideten Mädchen im Winter:</p>

<p>Das ist immer schwer mit dem Teilen, of gibt es Verträge oder aber die private bekanntschaft, die das verbieten.</p>

<p>Ich htte auch mal eine ex Feundin, die in allen Situationen extrem schnell anfing zu zittern, damit meine ich natürlich bei Kälte, nur ein wenig zu kat und ihe Beine haben so gezittert, dass sie kaum noch stehen konnte und bei Anstrengung war es auch so, annähernd bei jeder Sportübung zitterte ihr ganzer Körper, das war auch eine heiße Zeit. ;-)</p>

<p>Und ich habe noch versprochen, ich berichte über meine Ex-Freundin, aber wie
gesagt: Hat nichts mit Frieren zu tun, weil sie dafür nicht offen war. Als wir
uns während des Studiums kennengelernt haben, war sie einigermaßen schlank;
sonst hätte ich mich für sie auch ehrlich gesagt nicht interessiert. Als ich
ihr einmal ziemlich am Anfang in unserer Beziehung beim Umziehen zugeschaut
habe, habe ich ihr gesagt, wie schön sie doch sei und wie mir ihre schlanke
Figur gefalle. Das hat sie natürlich erstmal super gefreut, aber sie hat dann an
ihre Oberschenkel gefasst und mir gestanden, dass sie eigentlich etwas abnehmen
will, weil sie speziell ihre Schenkel zu $%!@ fände.</p>

<p>Ich fand ihre Beine damals eigentlich in Ordnung, aber konnte schon auch sehen,
dass da noch einiges Fett war und ohne das stellte ich mir sie noch schöner vor.
Das wollte ich aber nicht so direkt sagen und hab nur gesagt, dass ihre Schenkel
doch schön seien. Sie hat mir widersprochen und dann hab ich sie mal gefragt,
was sie denn wiege und wie viel dünner sie denn sein will. Sie hat gesagt, dass
sie 54 kg wiegt und gerne wieder unter 50 kg kommen will, weil sie zu ihrer
Schulzeit wohl mal 49 gewogen hatte. Sie war etwa 1,69 groß. Ich hab dann
zugegeben, dass das vermutlich schon super aussehen würde und da hat sie nur
gelacht und gesagt, dass ich sie also doch zu $%!@ finde. Dann hab ich erstmal
meinen Mund gehalten.</p>

<p>Sie hat wohl vorher schon gesund gegessen, aber im Laufe der nächsten Woche hat
sie dann ernster gemacht. Süßigkeiten hat sie dann gar nicht mehr akzeptiert,
Nudeln, Reis &amp; Co. auch nur noch wenig gegessen und generell wurden ihre
Portionen kleiner. Ich hab das alles ganz gerne gesehen und mochte es irgendwie,
wenn sie sich vom Abendessen nur eine Kelle genommen hat, während ich drei
hatte. Hab sie dann gefragt, wie es so läuft mit dem Abnehmen. Sie schien ein
bisschen schlecht drauf deswegen und hat sich beklagt, dass es nicht so recht
klappt. Ich hab sie dann ermutigt, nicht aufzugeben und doch mit mir zum
Trainieren zu kommen. Ich bin selbst ziemlich fit und gehe regelmäßig an einem
Klettergerüst bzw. einer öffentlichen Sportanlage in meiner Nähe trainieren.</p>

<p>Sie hatte noch nie in ihrem Leben wirklich trainiert und es hat ihr richtig gut
gefallen, als sie mal reingekommen war. Sie hat also gesünder und weniger
gegessen und dann auch Spaß am Trainieren gefunden und das hat sich dann
natürlich bezahlt gemacht. Ein paar Wochen später haben wir schon gesehen, dass
ihre Hüften weniger speckig waren. Ich hab ihr gesagt, dass ich finde, dass ihre
Hüften schon besser aussehen und da hat sie sich natürlich gefreut und mir
gesagt, dass sie jetzt bei 51 kg sei, aber schon besser aussehe, als damals in
der Schule, weil sie ein wenig trainierter sei. "Da geht aber schon noch was
oder?", hab ich sie dann gefragt. Sie war etwas irritiert und fragte, was ich
meinte. Ich fühlte mich ein bisschen ertappt, aber versuchte mein Glück und
sagte so etwas wie: "Na, du siehst schon viel besser aus, aber ein bisschen
weniger wäre schon noch eleganter oder?" Sie warf einen kritischen Blick auf
sich und stimmte mir zu. Wieder fasste sie sich an Schenkel und Bauch und ihre
Hände fanden noch viele weichen Stellen, um sich festzuhalten. "Du hast Recht,"
sagte sie. "Danke, dass du mich so motivierst!"</p>

<p>Das habe ich sozusagen als Lizenz gesehen und in der folgenden Zeit habe ich sie
dann oft ein bisschen angestachelt. Als wir z. B. einmal bei Freunden zum Essen
eingeladen waren, gab es zuerst einen Salat als Vorspeise. Als dann der
Hauptgang aufgetragen wurde und sie sich eben schöpfen wollte, habe ich sie
angezwinkert und scheinbar im Spaß gesagt: "Du bist doch auf Diät; ich dachte
der Salat genügt dir." Da hat sie den Löffel wieder zurückgelegt, den Topf
weitergereicht und uns also beim Essen zugeschaut.</p>

<p>Das ging dann eine Zeit so. Sie hat eigentlich immer genug gegessen, aber eben
immer gesund und hat sich eben keine Süßigkeiten oder so etwas gegönnt. Langsam
hat sie abgenommen und eines Tages kam sie zu mir zu Besuch - gekleidet in
bauchfreiem Top und einem superkurzen Höschen - und hat geprahlt: "Rate mal, wer
heute zum ersten Mal unter 45 gewogen hat?" Sie hat gestrahlt und ich habe ihr
natürlich bereitwillig meine Bewunderung ausgesprochen.</p>

<p>Dann war leider ein Punkt, an dem es etwas schief ging. Denn sie war ja
offensichtlich da, um sich Lob abzuholen für die tolle Figur, die sie dann
hatte. Und mir fiel - nachdem ich kurz anerkennend ihren flachen, definierten
Bauch gestreichelt hatte - nichts Besseres ein als ein bisschen etwas von dem
wenigen restlichen Speck, der noch an ihrem Bauch saß, zu kneifen und zu sagen:
"Echt gut, Süße! Nur noch ein bisschen weniger und du bist perfekt!" Anscheinend
hatte sie damit nicht gerechnet und war empört. In ihren Augen war wohl 44 bis
45 kg das Minimum, bis zu dem sie gehen wollte, und, als sie hörte, dass ich sie
gerne noch weiter abnehmen sehen würde, hat sie gesagt, dass ich einen an der
Waffel habe. Viele andere Leute bezeichneten sie ja schon als zu dünn oder
ungesund. Und sie fühlte sich zwar super, so wie sie zu dem Zeitpunkt war, aber
sie für sich war sie am Ziel und wollte nicht weiter abnehmen.</p>

<p>Das war nicht das erste Mal, dass ich etwas zu offensiv bei ihr war, aber es war
das gravierendste Mal, weil sie eben so stolz auf sich war und ich ihr gesagt
habe, dass es mir noch nicht reicht. Wir haben uns dann ausgesprochen und wieder
vertragen, aber es war nicht mehr so wie vorher. Nach zwei, drei Monaten und
insgesamt gar nicht viel mehr als einem Jahr haben wir uns dann wieder getrennt.
Sie wog zu dem Zeitpunkt etwa 45 bis 46 kg. Wir wohnen noch in derselben Stadt
und haben ein paar gemeinsame Freunde, sodass wir uns noch ab und zu über den
Weg laufen. Sie sieht immer noch toll aus, aber ich vermute, sie ist jetzt
wieder bei so 47 oder 48 kg.</p>

<p>Das Abnehmen hat ihr streckenweise schon echt Spaß gemacht und das war auch der
coolste Abschnitt unserer Beziehung. Aber leider hat sie nie so diese
Einstellung entwickelt, bei der sie es geradezu genießt, für ihr Aussehen ein
paar Unannehmlichkeiten zu leiden, wie das bei manchen Mädchen hier der Fall
ist. Wie gerne hätte ich mal so eine Göttin, die gertenschlank in einem Hauch
von Nichts mit mir draußen den Winter verbringt und sich dabei eine Erkältung
nach der anderen holt, ohne dass es sie stören würde.</p>

<p>Hi, beauty.takes.sacrifice und alle anderen !</p>

<p>Also zunächst mal danke für die Bilder. Die Schneeelfe auf den Bildern sieht süß aus. Meine Freundin ist durchaus ähnlich gebaut, aber nicht tätowiert (Gott sei Dank - ist kein nogo aber auch nicht was, worauf ich stehe), schwarzhaarig und definierter. Sie hat einen Körperfettanteil von deutlich unter 15%: Von der Körperform ist sie ähnlich, aber bei meiner Liebsten sieht man die Rippen und die einzelnen Muskel besser und ihr Bauch ist eingesunkener mit leichtem Sixpack.</p>

<p>Kann zwar mit G'schichten aus unserem (Liebes)leben aufwarten, aber Bilder und Videos zu teilen geht bei mir natürlich auch nicht, da es hier ja um meine Freundin und nicht um ein professionelles Modell geht und das ganze natürlich unsere Privatleben ist. Hab d'rum auch lange überlegt, ob ich überhaupt was schreiben soll, weil das reale Tatsachen von mir und meiner Lebensgefährtin sind. Umgekehrt les' ich sowas ja auch und find's gut, dass andere die selben Vorlieben haben. Denn natürlich sind nicht alle begeistert, wenn sich jemand so kasteit und absichtlich friert - als Liebesbeweis und Zeichen der eigenen Stärke. Die meisten Männer in unserer Umgebung heucheln zwar Fürsorglichkeit, himmeln Carina aber gleichzeitig für ihre Traumfigur und ihre Härte an und wünschen sich wahrscheinlich, dass ihre Mädels das auch tun würden. Negativ reagieren meist die anderen Frauen. Kann schon sein, dass sie ihr nacheifern und sie beneiden, weil ihre Figur schon extrem schön ist. Aber angefeindet wird sie deshalb auch. Ihr Anorexia nervosa, Masochismus oder sklavische Abhängigkeit von mir zu unterstellen, ist leider Standard. Es gibt in unserem Freundeskreis nur ein Mädel, die genauso figurbewusst ist und darum net ablästert und  - obwohl sie das selbst nicht schafft - meine Freundin auch für ihren Chillylook bewundert. Was dahinter steckt ist auch klar: das ist wie die Geschichte mit dem Fuchs und den sauren Trauben. Es ist leichter etwas runter zu machen, was ich nicht habe, weil ich mich dafür quälen müsste. Und ja, ich denk auch - selbst wenn sie das so nie direkt sagt - dass sie sich anderen Mädels überlegen fühlt. Und ich denke, dass sie dazu auch allen Grund hat. Nicht, dass ich jetzt wem anderen schlecht machen will. Ich hab selber auch schon mehrfach hier zugegeben, dass ich weder ihre Disziplin und ihre Härte, noch ihre Hingabe habe. Mag sein, dass das Masochismus ist (und von meiner Seite Sadismus), aber sie ist stolz auf ihre Figur und auf ihr Durchhaltevermögen und mir gefällt das Ergebnis und auch mit welcher Härte sie darum kämpft. Darum sagt sie auch, dass sie leidet. Das ist kein Jammern, das ist kein Mitleid heischen, sondern einfach die Feststellung: "Ich bin extrem hungrig, ich friere wie die Hölle, aber ich steh' das durch weil ich sexy sein will, hart bin, stark bin und meinen Freund so sehr liebe, dass ich alles für ihn tue." Und ich weiß das zu schätzen. Sehr sogar. Ich (aber natürlich auch viele andere Männer) bewundere, vergöttere, verehre und liebe sie dafür und das ist ihre Motivation und ihre "Belohnung" für die Quälerei. Sie hat mal - so ähnlich wie Martins Schwiegertochter - zu mir gesagt, dass ihr "Hunger nie zu quälend, das Training nie zu hart und die Kälte nie zu schlimm sein kann, solange sie mit mir zusammen sein darf". </p>

<p>Die Bestätigung, die sie kriegt, ist ihr tatsächlich wichtig als alles andere. Du hast es in deinem Posting als Perfektionismus bezeichnet. Für diese Perfektion tut sie alles. Klar leidet sie körperlich. Sie trainiert bis zur Erschöpfung, ernährt sich meist nur vegan, selten vegetarisch und das in Mengen, wo sie natürlich immer hungrig ist und obwohl sie ein Frostbeulchen ist, schwimmt sie zitternd im kältesten Wasser und rennt auch im Winter, wenn sie mit mir zusammen ist, meist nur mit sexy Klamotten herum 
= mit wenig Stoff und viel Gänsehaut. Sie ist auch nie eingeknickt. Also beim Essen auf keinen Fall, denn wenn sie grad mal wieder in ihrer "Cutting"-Phase ist, sich also nicht einmal ihren Salat gönnt und tageweise trotz trainieren nur Wasser und kalten Tee trinkt, schaut sie anderen sogar hungrig beim Essen zu. Sie hat in diesen Phasen auch schon für mich was gekocht. Hatte zwar initial ein extra schlechtes Gewissen, weil ihr knurrender Magen der Beweis war, wie sehr sie sich da beherrschen musste, aber wenn ich ihr das dann dafür gesagt hab und ihr über die Rippen und den Waschbrettbauch gestreichelt habe, dann hat sie das so heiß gemacht, dass sie förmlich über mich her gefallen ist.
Bei der Kälte ist es so, dass sie zwar nie die Arme verschränkt, sich was anzieht oder in die Wärme geht - das würde sie nicht tun, selbst wenn sie nackt im Schneesturm wäre - aber sie liebt es, wenn sie sich zu mir kuscheln und bei mir aufwärmen kann (und ich natürlich auch). Da ich immer warme Hände habe, ist es für sie extrem anturnend, wenn sie eine Gänsehaut hat und ich sie streichle. Sie zittert dann zwar noch mehr, weil ihr die Kälte mehr bewusst wird, aber sie mag es extrem. Wenn ich merke, dass sie es gar nicht mehr aushält oder sie mir das auch sagt, nehme ich sie meist in den Arm oder ... naja, eh klar ! ;-)</p>

<p>Nochwas zum Thema Motivation und Pushen. Ich denke, du musst die (im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes) Schmerzgrenze deiner Freundin genau kennen und gerade wenn ein Maedchen bereit ist, aus Liebe, Perfektionismus, Leidenschaft, Hunger nach Zuwendung oder warum auch immer wirklich alles fuer dich zu tun, dann ist es dein Job, sie auch vor sich selbst und auch vor dir zu beschuetzen. Das Gefuehl, das jemand Wachs in deinen Haenden ist, ist geil aber auch gefaehrlich. Ich liebe meine Freundin und hatte immer das Beduerfnis, meine Maedels zu beschuetzen, aber gerade bei ihr merke ich, dass es doch auch eine gehoerige Portion Sadismus ist, die hinter meiner Faszination fuer das Alles steckt. Nachdem sie das auch geniesst, ist es okay. Aber es ist eben wichtig, die richtige Grenze zu ziehen. Sie zu gefaehrden oder gar zu verletzen ' psychisch oder physisch - ist ein no go. Das ist grad am Anfang manchmal gar nicht so einfach.
Wir haben unseren ersten gemeinsamen Urlaub in Polen verbracht. Ich hatte in Danzig ein kurzes Geschaeftsmeeting und bin mit ihr zu einem einsamen Strandhaus an der Ostseekueste weitergefahren. Nachdem es Ende Oktober war, war das Wetter lausig mit eisigem Wind und Regen satt, aber das Strandhaus war wunderschoen, gemuetlich und einsam gelegen mit einem Holzsteg fuer den Sommer, der ins Meer hinaus gefuehrt hat ... ein ideales Liebesnest.
Was ich damals noch nicht wusste, war, dass meine Freundin extreme Flugangst hat und vor allem sehr schnell, sehr grosses Heimweh kriegt. Dementsprechend lief es nicht, wie geplant. Ich war maechtig enttaeuscht und sauer, ein Wort ergab das andere, ich schrie sie an und sprach von Trennung, sie hat geheult, ich hab die Nacht, so gern ich sie mit ihr verbracht haette, aus Trotz auf der Coach verbracht ... Szenen einer normalen Beziehung halt.
Am naechsten Tag stand Schweigen am Programm: so suess ich ihre Bemuehungen, mich zu versoehnen auch gefunden habe und so heiss ich auch auf sie war, so wild entschlossen war ich, ihr nicht das Gefuehl zu geben, dass sie einfach zickig sein und mich dann locker um den Finger wickeln kann. Es war ein Machtspiel und ich genoss den Umstand, dass die Vorstellung mich vergrault und keine Wirkung mehr auf mich zu haben, sie merklich in Panik versetzte und war gespannt, wie weit sie wirklich zu gehen bereit war.
Carina hatte einen tollen Brunch für mich gemacht. Obwohl sie bereits seit dem letzten Vormittag nichts mehr gegessen hatte, trank sie nur einen ungezuckerten Tee und man sah ihr deutlich an, dass sie großen Hunger hatte. Nachdem sie mehrmals ihr T-Shirt hochschob und mit der Hand über ihren eingesunkenen Waschbrettbauch strich, der deutlich hoerbar knurrte, war das wohl auch gewollt, dass ich ihren Hunger und ihre Disziplin bemerken (und bewundern) sollte. Normalerweise habe ich immer ein extrem schlechtes Gewissen, wenn ich mein Essen geniesse, waehrend sie hungrig neben mir sitzt und versuche es zu vermeiden, um sie nicht zu quaelen, aber in der Situation war mir das egal. Im Gegenteil: ich wollte, dass sie sich quaelt. 'Hungrig ?'.'Du magst es doch, wenn du meine Knochen siehst und mein Bauch ganz flach und ausgehungert ist und ich mach' alles für dich !' Am liebsten haette ich ihr jetzt bereits die Klamotten vom Leib gerissen und ihrem Blick nach, hat sie genau das bezweckt. 'Am zweiten Tag ist das Hungern immer schlimm, aber ich halt das durch. Ich muss heute auch noch trainieren ... Es ist kalt und regnet. Egal. Vielleicht kann ich es ja wieder gut machen, wenn mein Sixpack ganz besonders hart und definiert ist.'
Das Wetter draussen wurde immer schlimmer. Ich hatte es mir zunaechst mit einem Buch gemuetlich gemacht und beobachtete fasziniert, dass meine sportliche Schoenheit mit einem bauchfreien Tanktop und einer Trainingshose in den Regen hinaus ging. 'Ich bin bei Einbruch der Dunkelheit wieder zurueck'. Ich wischte einen kurzen Anflug von Sorge zur Seite und wuenschte ihr sarkastisch viel Vergnuegen. Die Vorstellung, dass sie stundenlang im eiskalten Regen, hungrig und erschoepft den Strand entlang laufen wuerde, hat mich fasziniert. Ich schaemte mich zwar dafuer, dass ich es genossen habe, dass sie leiden wuerde, aber fands trotzdem geil. Tatsaechlich stolperte sie mehrere Stunden spaeter, durchnaesst, ausser Atem und voellig erschoepft bei der Tuer herein. Sie war ein unbeschreiblich schoener Anblick. Durch das heftige Atmen sah man ihre Rippen noch besser und sie zog rhythmisch ihren blaeulich angelaufenen, mit einer Gaensehaut bedeckten, nassen Waschbrettbauch ein. Ihre nassen Haare hingen in Straenen über ihr Gesicht und ihre Lippen waren ganz blau und zitterten. Jetzt, als sie zur Ruhe kam, machte sich die Kaelte bemerkbar und ein Froesteln ging durch ihren drahtigen und etwas muskuloesen Koerper. In diesem Moment durchzuckte es mich, dass ich ganz vergessen hatte, die Heizung im Keller wieder anzumachen. Ich hatte zusaetzlich einen Pullover angezogen, fuer sie waere es aber eiskalt im Haus und die Heizung versorgt auch die Dusche mit warmen Wasser. Ich wollte schon aufspringen und in den Keller rennen, aber die Vorstellung, sie noch mehr frieren zu sehen war zu sexy. Ich weiss, dass das gemein und egoistisch war. Aber ich wollte ihre Grenzen ausloten und habe es einfach genossen, zu sehen, mit welcher Haerte dieses zarte, zerbrechlich wirkende Geschoepf zu leiden bereit war. 
Obwohl die kalte Dusche fuer sie sicher die Hoelle gewesen ist und sie mittlerweile so zitterte, dass sie kaum aus ihrer Wasserflasche trinken konnte, hatte sie trotz abgeschalteter Heizung nur eine kurze Sporthose und ein nun noch knapperes Sporttop an. Es war offensichtlich, dass sie mich verfuehren wollte, um den Streit zu schlichten und Gott weiss, dass es fuer mich genauso eine Herausfoderung war, mich an diesem Punkt nicht mit wehenden, weissen Fahnen, ihrem Sexappeal zu ergeben. Ihr schwarzen Haare waren feucht und komplett struppig, ihre blau gefrorenen Lippen bibberten vor Kaelte und ihre schoene, seidige, leicht gebraeunte Haut war von einer Gaensehaut bedeckt. Ihre leicht muskuloesen, langen, schlanken Beine zitterten und sogar ihre Zehen waren blau von der Kaelte. Sie kauerte frierend, aber ohne Decke in der Ecke der Coach und zitterte still vor sich hin waehrend sie mich sehnsuechtig ansah und darauf wartete, dass ich ihr verzeihen und sie waermen wuerde. 
An diesem Punkt haette die Geschichte jetzt fuer sie und mich ein Happy End finden muessen. Da war die Grenze, von der ich am Anfang gesprochen habe. Aber leider war ich von dem Machtgefuehl, das ich in diesem Moment hatte so zugedroehnt, dass ich mich wie ein Arsch aufgefuehrt und meinem Sadismus freien Lauf gelassen habe. Und nein, darauf bin ich nicht stolz, auch wenn es vielleicht so klingt.
Ich hab also weiter auf cool gemacht und sie ignoriert. Obwohl sie ihre, eiskalten, zitternden Haende beim mir zu waermen versuchte und mir nochmals ganz leise und zittrig gesagt hat, wie sehr sie mich liebt und dass es ihr leid tut, dass sie staendig herum genoergelt hat weil sie eben nicht gerne verreist, habe ich ihr, statt sie in meinen Armen zu waermen nur wortlos ein Decke unter die Nase gehalten. 'Du sagst ja immer, dass du so hart bist. Also solange du nicht bei 8 Grad in die Ostsee schwimmen gehst, reicht die Decke auch. Ausserdem weißt du nur zu gut, dass du, sobald ich dich angreife, gewonnen hast'. Ich weiss natuerlich nicht, ob es echte Verzweiflung war oder sie nur das Spiel mitgespielt hat, weil sie bemerkt hat, dass ich seit 1 Stunde eine beinahe leere Buchseite 'gelesen' habe und der Zippverschluss meiner Jeans knapp vor dem Aufplatzen war, aber ich hatte den Satz noch nicht ausgesprochen, als sie zitternd ihr Gewand auszog und zur Tuer ging. Da sie jetzt schon total ausgehungert, vom Training muede und vollkommen unterkuehlt war, begann ich es zu bereuen, was ich gerade gesagt hatte, aber ich war mir ' weil ich bisher auch noch nie ein Maedchen hatte, dass so tapfer, leidenschaftlich und hingebungsvoll war ' sicher, dass sie kneifen wuerde. Tatsaechlich blieb sie nach nur wenigen Schritten auf dem Holzsteg stehen und der eiskalte Wind liess sie unkontrolliert zittern. Sie zog den Bauch bis zur Wirbelsaeule ein und warf mir mit klappernden Zaehne eines ihrer sexy Laecheln zu. Ich warf mir eine Jacke ueber schlenderte betont langsam hinter ihr her. Ich wollte den erotischen Anblick meiner ausgehungerten, nackten Italienerin, die so sehr die Waerme und die Sonne liebte und fuer mich aber trotzdem so schrecklich fror, noch kurz geniessen um sie dann in den Arm zu nehmen und sie von ihren Qualen zu erloesen. Zu meinem Entsetzen sprintete sie jedoch los und sprang in das eiskalte Wasser. Ich stand starr vor Schreck da. Die Wassertemperatur war tatsaechlich nur 8 Grad, sie hatte zwei Tage nicht gegessen, war den ganzen Tag Laufen gewesen, jetzt schon so unterkuehlt, dass sie pausenlos gezittert hatte und bei einem so geringen Koerperfettanteil, wie sie ihn hatte, wuerde ihr das eiskalte Ostsee-Wasser so schnell, die restliche Waerme entziehen, dass sie Gefahr lief, abzusaufen. Ich war in Panik. Ich rannte hinter ihr her über den Steg. Leider bin ich total unsportlich und uebergewichtig und es dauerte auch in der Dunkelheit, bis ich gesehen hab, dass sie es zurueck zum Steg geschafft und sich an einem der Pfosten gehalten hatte. Eine Welle hatte Sie gegen den Steg gedrueckt und ihre Schulter war aufgeschunden und blutete leicht. Ich bekam ihren Arm zu fassen und zog sie aus dem eiskaltem Wasser. 'Mach so einen Scheiss nie wieder !'. 'Hast, nicht geglaubt, dass ich mich da rein traue. Tu alles für dich, egal wie weh es tut'. 
Ich hab sie geschnappt und zurueck getragen. Ich bin erschrocken wie leicht sie war. Ich verband ihre Schulter und trocknete sie ab. In meinem Kopf lief foermlich ein Gewitter ab: Ich hab mich dafuer gehasst, dass ich sie so gequaelt habe, obwohl sie das erste Maedchen war, das mich selbstlos und ohne wenn und aber liebt, dass ich sie durch meinen Egoismus und meinen Sadismus in Gefahr gebracht habe, andererseits war ich noch immer wie besoffen davon, dass sie bereit gewesen war, fuer mich das durch zustehen und der Anblick ihres nackten, durchtrainierten Koerper, der unablaesslich zitterte, war einfach nur geil. Jeden einzelnen Muskel zittern zu sehen, waehrend ich sie abtrocknete, ihre Gaensehaut zu spueren, ihre Rippen und den ausgehungerten, flachen Bauch zu streicheln wie sie neben mir lag, das war Perfektion. Ihre Brustwarzen waren hart wie Steine. Sie war so unterkuehlt und erschoepft, dass sich ihre Muskeln immer wieder zusammenkrampften und die Prellung in ihrer Schulter tat ihr so weh, dass sie ' wenn ich sie versehentlich zu hart dort anpackte ' vor Schmerzen aufgeschrien hat. Trotzdem klammerte sie sich leidenschaftlich an mich. Das war mit der beste Sex, den ich in meinem Leben hatte und ihrer Reaktion oder ihren mehrfachen Reaktionen nach zu schliessen fuer sie genauso. Bevor sie erschoepft, gluecklich, aber noch immer unkontrolliert zitternd, in meine Arme gekuschelt eingeschlafen ist, habe ich ihr versprochen, dass ich ihr nicht mehr so leicht mit Trennung drohen und mehr auf sie aufpassen werde. So toll es war: Es hat mir doch einiges vor Augen gefuehrt: 1. Ich bin nicht so moralisch integer, wie ich immer geglaubt hab. 2. Ich liebe sie ... ich habe das bei dieser Gelegenheit wahrscheinlich auch zum ersten Mal explizit ausgesprochen. 3. Sie geht wirklich bis zum Aeussersten und so sehr ich ihren Mut, ihre Haerte zu sich und ihre Leidensfaehigkeit und Hingabe auch bewundere, so sehr bin ich auch dadurch verpflichtet, die Notbremse zu ziehen, weil sie es nicht tut, sondern es bis zum bitteren (oder in diesem Fall gerade noch suessen) Ende durchzieht. Das ist ein Lernprozess.
Genauso ist es ein Lernprozess zu verstehen, dass man sich solche Gefuehle auch zugestehen und geniessen darf, sofern es freiwillig ist, sich am Schluss beide gut dadurch fuehlen und niemand gefaehrdet wird oder gar zu Schaden kommt. *Moralaposteltum: OFF</p>

<p>Hallo an alle,
Ich möchte mich auch mal wieder melden. Zuerst noch mal vielen Dank für die tollen Beiträge. Ich beneide euch um eure tollen Frauen und muss gestehen, dass ich auch meinen Sohn um seine Freundin beneide, sie heisst übrigens Lisa, und ehrlich gesagt  ,genieße ich jeden Augenblick mit den beiden zusammen zu sein. Gestern war sie allein bei mir und ich habe sie nach ihrem Gewicht gefragt, aber sie hat mir keine Zahl verraten, nur ausweichend gesagt, dass sie alles versucht weiter abzunehmen, um so dünn zu werden, wie die jungen Mädchen, denen mein Sohn immer nachschaut. Sie hat in meinen Augen eine Traumfigur, ihre Rippen und die Wirbelsäule zeichnen sich deutlich ab, ihre Hüftknochen sind sichtbar und ihr Bauch wölbt sich fast nach innen, durch ihr intensives Training hat sie fast kein Fett aber deutliche leichte Muskelansätze unter ihrer Haut, was mir sehr gut gefällt. Das habe ich ihr auch gesagt und ihr dabei über ihren braungebrannten Rücken gestreichelt. Ich habe ihr auch nochmal ins Gewissen geredet, weniger zu rauchen. Sie hat sich zur Kettenraucherin entwickelt. Wir saßen draußen und sie hat sich sofort eine neue Zigarette angezündet, nachdem sie eine aufgeraucht hat. Dabei setzte ihr ein Hustenanfall nach dem anderen zu. Sie freute sich über meine Komplimente und   gab zu, dass sie viel zu viel raucht und manchmal so wenig isst, dass sie beim Schwimmtraining keine Luft mehr bekommt und ihre Kräfte kaum reichen, das gegenüberliegende Seeufer zu erreichen. Aber nur so könne sie noch abnehmen, um ihren Freund nicht zu verlieren. Dann umarmte sie mich ganz fest und flüsterte mir ins Ohr, wie sehr sie meinen Sohn liebt und mich als väterlichen Freund sieht, dem sie vertrauen kann. Also bin ich wieder am Zweifeln, ob ich mit meinem Sohn reden sollte, denn vielleicht ist wirklich etwas Sadismus im Spiel, gerade wenn ich an bestimmte Erlebnisse im Winter denke. Wir unternahmen eine Ausfahrt im Pferdeschlitten zu meinem Geburtstag. Für Lisa und mich war es eine Überraschung, sie holten mich ab, mein Sohn in Winterkleidung und Lisa wie im Hochsommer im Minirock und bauchfreiem Trägertop. Mein Sohn sagte nur, dass wir einen Ausfug in den Winterwald machen und ich mich warm anziehen soll. Ich schaute auf Lisa und fragte sie: Kommst du nicht mit oder ziehst du dich noch um? Doch ich komme mit oder magst du mich nicht mehr in knappen Klamotten ? Ja aber es ist Winter, du wirst erfrieren. Ach was, für euch frieren ich auch mal. Wir also los. 
Ich schreibe später weitere.</p>

<p>Viele tolle Geschichten, wenn wir es schaffen würden Videos zu haben oder zu teilen wäre es noch viel besser, aber ich sehe das einige Erfahrungen mit zitternden Frauen gemacht haben und es ist schön das es nicht nur mir gefällt. ;-)</p>

<p>Hat jemand auch schon mal eine Frau an ihrer Grenze gesehen? Also so das sie sagte "sie kann nicht mehr" oder das sie vor lauter zittern ihren gesamten Körper nicht mehr im Griff hatte? Würde mich interessieren. </p>

<p>Tolle Beiträge von euch, danke!</p>

<p>icemanX, du kannst dich mit so einem willensstarken Engel wirklich glücklich
schätzen. Cool, dass sie sogar eine noch bessere Figur hat als das Mädchen auf
den Bildern oben (Ich finde deren Figur schon echt toll, auch wenn ich zugebe,
dass sie mir etwas durchtrainierter und mit ein paar Kilogramm weniger auf den
Rippen und Hüften noch besser gefiele.) und scheint sich ja wirklich durch
nichts in ihrem Ziel, immer die Schönste und Disziplinierteste zu sein, beirren
zu lassen. Wie verträgt sich das mit dem anderen figurbewussten Mädel in eurem
Freundeskreis? Sie scheinen sich ja gut zu verstehen (sofern ich das aus einem
Satz herauslesen kann), aber kommt da auch mal so etwas wie Konkurrenz auf?</p>

<p>Die Erfahrung an der Ostsee liest sich allerdings wirklich dramatisch; zum Glück
ist alles gut ausgegangen. Sie scheint wirklich gar nicht auf ihre natürlichen
Grenzen achtzugeben, wenn sie tatsächlich noch nie eingeknickt ist. Umso mehr
hast du selbstverständlich Recht, indem du dich da auch in der Verantwortung
siehst, sie nicht zu weit gehen zu lassen. Andererseits ist dieses Balancieren
auf der Grenze des Machbaren sicher auch für sie ein Riesenkick und sie ist
sicher ein wenig enttäuscht, wenn du sie nicht ab und zu herausforderst und
ihren Willen und ihre Leidensbereitschaft auf die Probe stellst. Schließlich
hattet ihr am Ende ja einen sehr schönen Abend zu zweit, wenn ich das richtig
einschätze ;-) Vielleicht kannst du ja nächsten Winter mal überprüfen, ob sie
wirklich selbst im Schneesturm noch ihre Erscheinung an erste Stelle stellt, wie
du es oben vermutet hast.</p>

<p>Martin99, schade, dass Lisa ihr Gewicht nicht nennen wollte (vielleicht will sie
warten, bis sie an ihrem Zielgewicht ist?), aber Zahlen sind ja auch nicht so
wichtig … Du hast sie ja gut beschrieben und sie scheint ja echt schon eine
tolle schlanke Figur zu haben. Gerade sichtbare Hüftknochen machen viel aus,
finde ich. Ich liebe z. B. den Look, wenn man unter einer engen Hose oder einem
Kleid schön die scharfen Hüftknochen eines Mädchens bewundern kann. Es ist schon
verständlich, dass sie auch noch den letzten Speck loswerden will, wenn dein
Sohn immer noch regelmäßig jüngere und schlankere Mädels zum Hinterherschauen
findet. Gerade jetzt im Sommer, wenn sie nicht die einzige in knappen Klamotten
ist, ist eine Topfigur natürlich wichtig. Andererseits muss sie vielleicht auch
lernen, sich damit abzufinden, dass es immer schlankere und schönere und v. a.
jüngere Frauen geben wird. Aber wenn es kalt wird, kann sie natürlich
auftrumpfen, wenn sie weiterhin so tapfer bleibt, und das weiß dein Sohn
hoffentlich zu schätzen.</p>

<p>Ich hoffe nur, dass sie von dem vielen Rauchen wegkommt. Ohne wieder Zuzunehmen
natürlich; das wäre sonst natürlich ärgerlich.</p>

<p>Dass sie allerdings bis kurz vor Erschöpfung in einem See schwimmt und dann auch
noch quer rüber, klingt auch ziemlich besorglich. Sie kann doch am Rand
schwimmen, damit sie es zur Not nicht so weit zum Ufer hat? Oder macht sie das,
um sicherzustellen, dass sie sich beim Training nicht betrügt, indem sie ans
Ufer schwimmt, obwohl sie noch ein kleines bisschen rauskitzeln könnte? Wie
lange schwimmt sie schon in dem See? Letzten Winter schon oder erst seit
Neuerem? Falls es erst eine neuere Sache ist, bin ich mal gespannt, wie lange
sie es durchhält, wenn das Wasser im Herbst kälter wird.</p>

<p>Bin jedenfalls sehr gespannt, wie sie sich auf der winterlichen Schlittenfahrt
geschlagen hat. Ich hoffe, sie konnte tapfer bleiben und hat deinen Sohn nicht
enttäuscht ;-) Obwohl ich es natürlich gerne lese, was eure Lisa in der Kälte
mit euch mitmachen muss, verstehe ich schon auch deine Sorge, denn dein Sohn
scheint wirklich wenig Erbarmen zu haben. Zeigt er denn nicht auch manchmal ein
bisschen Verständnis? Er muss doch auch auf seine Freundin achtgeben, wie es ja
sogar icemanX beteuert hat.</p>

<p>Übrigens, wie ist es denn mit Lisas Garderobe? So wie sie abnimmt, ist ihr
sicher schon die eine oder andere Hose zu groß geworden oder? Kauft sie schon
neue Sachen und was macht sie mit den alten? Was sagt ihr Freund zu dem Thema?</p>

<p>bassdrummer, das würde mich auch interessieren. So sehr mir nämlich ein tapferes
Mädchen gefällt, das sich selbst im tiefsten Winter keine wärmere Kleidung
gönnt, so sehr macht es mich doch irgendwie (auf eine fast böse Weise?) auch an,
wenn sie einmal zugeben muss, dass sie es nicht mehr schafft. Wenn ihr Stolz
sozusagen durch die unbarmherzige Kälte der Natur gebrochen wird und sie sich
eingestehen muss, dass sie doch nur ein Mensch ist. Und beim nächsten Mal wird
sie dennoch wieder versuchen, das Frieren durchzustehen, ohne sich viel anmerken
zu lassen.</p>

<p>Hi, Martin 99.</p>

<p>Also deine Lisa ist offenbar genauso ein tapferes, hingebungsvolles und beinhartes Maedchen wie die anderen Eisprinzessinnen hier im Blog. Bin gespannt auf die Schlittenstory: wenn sie so stark abgenommen hat wird sie in dem bauchfreien Trägertop und mit nackten Beinen sicher sehr gefroren haben. Muss beauty.takes.sacrifice zustimmen, dass das Gewicht gar nicht so der Punkt ist. Carina hat mir gestern erzaehlt, dass sie in den letzten Monaten ihr Gewicht auf knapp unter 45 kg reduziert hat, weil sie nicht zu muskuloes = maskulin aussehen will, aber sie bleibt immer in diesem Bereich. Das entscheidende ist, warum sie super aussieht, dass sie ihren Koerperfettanteil minimiert hat. Ihre Haut ist selbst am Bauch nur wenige mm duenn und ganz zart und man sieht speziell an ihren Oberschenkeln, Schultern und Armen die Furchen zwischen den einzelnen Muskeln > also das gefaellt mir extrem gut. </p>

<p>Eine andere Sache ist die Raucherei: wenn Lisa beim Schwimmen ausser Puste kommt, dann deshalb und nicht weil sie hungrig ist. Klar muss sie viel Energie aufs Schwimmen investieren und wenn das Wasser kalt ist, verbrennt sie mehr Energie um sich warm zu halten. Das ist der Trainingseffekt. Meine Liebste hasst kaltes Wasser und froestelt selbst im Sommer oft schon bevor sie rein springt weil sie eben auch so ein zarter Hase ohne Isolierschicht ist, aber sie schwimmt trotzdem tapfer im kaeltesten Wasser eben weil sie beim Frieren viele Kalorien und viel Fett verbrennt. Vielleicht kannst du sie ja motivieren, das Rauchen zu reduzieren, wenn du ihr klar machst, dass sie sportlich und damit beim Abnehmen erfolgreicher waere, wenn sie aufhoert. Klar wird das hungern haerter dadurch, aber gesuender ist es alle Mal und sie wirkt auch juenger. Die Idee am Ufer zu schwimmen, halte ich uebrigens auch fuer sehr weise !</p>

<p>Was die Konkurrenz zu dem anderen Maedchen betrifft, nach der beauty.takes.sacrifice (Hi auch an dich an dieser Stelle) gefragt hat, so haben die beiden einmal eine Wette ausgetragen, die sowohl in den Blog als auch zum aufgeben passt. Sophia ist die Freundin meines Stellvertreters in der Firma, der mir wirklich eine grosse Hilfe und schon lange kein Angestellter, sondern ein Freund und Partner fuer mich geworden ist. Ich habe ihn und seine Freundin daher zu einem gemeinsamen Wochenende in mein Ferienhaus eingeladen. Das liegt ziemlich hoch und es war Februar mit Temperaturen von unter null.
Natuerlich war die Bude gut geheizt und die beiden Maedels daher leicht bekleidet.
Sophia ist zwar etwas groesser und kurviger als meine Carina, hat aber genauso eine super Figur. Die beiden Damen haben sich auf Anhieb verstanden und wenn die eine nicht blond und aus der Ukraine und die andere schwarzhaarig und aus Sizilien stammen wuerde, koennte man sie glatt fuer Schwestern halten.</p>

<p>Beim Abendessen wurde dabei auch offensichtlich, dass Sophia genauso eine Hungerkuenstlerin wie Carina ist und die beiden haben auch ueber Trainingsplaene philosophiert und wie sie ihr Fett am Bauch und an den Beinen reduzieren. Irgendwann kam dann das Thema auf, dass ihnen durch das abnehmen leicht kalt wird und Carina trumpfte damit auf, dass sie sich - egal wie sehr sie friert - trotzdem sexy anzieht, weil mir das Gefallen wuerde. Mein Kollege hat seine Freundin natuerlich gleich in Schutz genommen und betont, wie toll er sie auch mit Klamotten findet, obwohl er es immer extrem aufregend gefunden hat, wenn Carina sichtbar frierend, aber figurbetont angezogen war. Zu meiner Ueberraschung war Sophia im Unterschied zu den anderen Maedels nicht beleidigt, sondern wollte offenbar beweisen, dass sie genauso hart wie meine Freundin sein koennte. Ein Wort ergab das andere und die zwei haben um ... weiss gar nicht um was, is auch egal .... gewettet, wer es laenger in der Kaelte aushaelt. Also sind die zwei nur mit Slip und BH bekleidet, barfuß hinaus in den Schnee. Es war zwar relativ windstill und nur knapp unter 0 aber für die beiden war es trotzdem hart. Obwohl wir zwei Maenner maximal eingemummelt waren, war uns sogar nach 10 min kalt. Da Carina etwas kleiner und doch deutlich magerer ist, begann sie natuerlich frueher zu zittern, was Sophia, die auch schon eine Gaensehaut hatte und mit den Lippen bebte zu einem siegessicheren Laecheln verleitete. 'Also deine Freundin zittert schon deutlich.' So sehr Sophias Lover das Schauspiel genoss, so sehr sah man ihn an, dass er seine Liebste gerne gewaermt haette und auch froh gewesen waere, wenn sie nicht zu lange haette leiden muessen, weil Carina aufgibt. Da ich mit ihr schon eine Weile zusammen war, wusste ich, dass es fuer sie zwar hart wird weil sie, trotzdem sie sich staendig der Kaelte aussetzt, nicht abgehaertet und eben sehr duenn ist, dass sie aber eher erfrieren als aufgeben wuerde. Tatsaechlich begannen nun auch Sophias Oberschenkel und Haende merklich zu zittern, waehrend Carina bereits am ganzen Koerper bibberte und so laut mit den Zaehnen klapperte, dass ich es bis zu mir hoeren konnte. Waehrend Sophia aber bereits zunehmend beklagte, dass ihre Fuesse schmerzten und die Kaelte sie fertigt macht, strich Carina sich nur mit zitternden Haenden ueber ihre Rippen und den eingesunkenen Waschbrettbauch und fragte mich scheinheilig, ob ich sie eh waermen wuerde. Es war klar, dass ihre Fuesse im Schnee genauso weh taten, aber waehrend Sophia begann herum zu huepfen, blieb Carina zwar zitternd aber ruhig stehen und tat wie wenn nichts waere. Irgendwann nahm sie sogar Sophia, die mittlerweile genauso zitterte in den Arm und bot ihr an sie zu waermen. Also ... die zwei durchtrainierten Maedels, die sich frierend aneinander kuschelten haben bei uns Maennern zweifelsfrei die Temperatur in die Hoehe schnalzen lassen. Als Sophia gemerkt hat, wie kalt sich der Koerper ihrer Kontrahentin angefuellt hat und wie sehr sie trotzdem entschlossen war, das durchzustehen, hat sie aufgegeben. Ihr Freund schnappte sie und trug sie in die Huette, da ihre Fuesse so kalt waren, dass ihr das gehen weht tat. Die zwei verstanden im Zimmer und ich denke, dass sie auch viel Spass beim aufwaermen hatten. Carina stand noch immer zitternd im Schnee und sah mich teils herausfordernd und teils sehnsuechtig an. Sie bettelte mich mit Schmollmuendchen und zitternden Haenden an. Als ich nicht sofort reagierte, zog sie sich ganz aus und kam betont langsam auf mich zu: 'Willst du mich noch lange leiden lassen ?' Sie nahm meine Hand und legte sie auf ihren zitternden Bauch. Sie war wirklich eiskalt und schepperte vor Kaelte. Ich hab sie vorsichtig auf ihre blauen, bebenden Lippen gekuesst und gefragt, wie lange sie es noch aushaelt. 'Wenn du mich so kuesst, ewig.' Klar sind wir wieder sofort im Bett gelandet. Es hat zwar lange gedauert, bis sie aufgehoert hat zu zittern, aber auch dieser Abend hat fuer uns beide ein sehr, sehr vergnuegliches Ende gefunden.</p>

<p>Ein vergnügliches Ende habe icha uch noch....</p>

<p>Eine meiner Ex stand mal im Mantel vor mir und sagte, sie möchte in den Wald, einen Spaziergang machen. Abgesehen davon, dass es bereits dunkel war, empfand ich das bis dahin nicht als besonders und stimmte zu, wir sind also los. Sie hatte einen wirklich langen Mantel an und ich wusste daher nicht was sie drunter trug. 
Nach einiger Zeit im Wald bemerkte ich, wie langam ihre Lippen anfingen zu zittern. Ich fragte wieso ihr kalt sei, sie habe doch einen langen Mantel an... sie lächelte und sagte "ja, aber nur den" Mir war dann natürlich sofort klar was los war... wenige Minuten später zitterte ihr Körper sichtlich unter dem Mantel und sie fragte mich, ob ich nicht mit unter den Mantel möchte.... sie öffnete ihn und stellte sich direkt vor mich... sie wollte den Mantel um uns beide schwigen, was aber nicht klappte, da der Mantel zu kurz adfür war, also sagte sie "dann eben nicht" und zog ihn komplett aus... Nun stand sie nur noch in Unterwäsche und hohen Stiefeln vor mir und zitterte immer stärker.... ihr ist natürlich aufgefallen, wie sehr mich das erfreute und spielte mit ihrem zitternden Körper.... zeigte mir das sie leidet, aber es geil findet.... Auch dieser Abend hatte ein vergnügliches Ende. :-)</p>

<p>Hallo an alle, 
Ich denke, dass euch Lisa gefallen würde. Ihre Figur ist sehr schlank,aber sie ist kein abgemagertes Knochengestell, man kann ihre Hüftknochen, Rippen, Schulterblätter usw deutlich sehen, aber auch ihre definierten Muskeln erkennen. Sie hat herrlich reine gebräunte Haut unter der kein Gramm  Fett zu sehen ist, nur sie selbst findet sich zu $%!@. Ihre Hüftknochen versteckt sie nicht unter Hosen, sie trägt fast nur Miniröcke auf Hüfte, so dass ihre Hüftknochen herrlich zu sehen sind und ihr nach innen gewölbter Bauch gut zur Geltung kommt. Sie hat viele neue Klamotten ,seit sie abgenommen hat, die mein Sohn aussucht, die immer freizügiger geworden sind und sie überhaupt nicht vor Kälte schützen können. So auch zu besagter Schlittenfahrt. Als wir am Waldhotel ankamen, nahm mein Sohn unsere Wintermäntel aus dem Kofferraum und fragte Lisa: Hast du auch eine Jacke für die Schlittenfahrt mit? Lisa: Ja, die habe ich auf deinen Mantel gelegt. Mein Sohn mit einem Lächeln: Oh, die muss ich wohl vergessen haben. Tut mir leid. Lisa: Kann ich mir nicht vorstellen. Ich darauf: Was machen wir denn nun. Vielleicht haben sie Decken auf dem Schlitten. Lisa zitterte schon leicht,hustete jetzt noch stärker als im Auto und meinte: ist nicht schlimm, die Jacke war eh zu dünn, um zu mich wärmen. Wir waren zu zeitig da, mein Sohn schlug vor einen Spaziergang durch den Wald zu unternehmen. Wir starteten mein Sohn und ich in dicker Winterkleidung und Lisa stapfte in einem Minirock und einem dünnen bauchfreiem Trägertop durch den Schnee. Die Sonne schien zwar aber ich spürte einen eisigen Wind im Gesicht. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich meine Blicke nicht von ihrer braungebrannten Gänsehaut lassen konnte. Ich bewunderte Lisa, wie es ihr scheinbar nichts ausmachte, trotz ihrer Erkältung,die sie den ganzen Winter nicht los wurde, unbeschwert mit uns plauderte. Als wir eine kurze Pause einlegten, konnte ich beobachten, wie sehr sie frieren musste, sie zitterte am ganzen Körper und ihre Gänsehaut wurde immer blasser. Ich nahm sie in den Arm und sagte: Oh Gott, es ist schön so eine tolle Frau im Arm zu halten, aber dir muss doch unglaublich kalt sein? Ihre Augen leuchteten, ihre Zähne klapperten, sie drückte ihren zitternden Körper an mich: In deinem Arm spüre ich keine Kälte....
Später mehr....</p>

<p>Hi zusammen. Ich hab jetzt kaum Zeit, aber wollte doch danke für die tollen Erzählungen sagen.</p>

<p>basedrummer, das Model ist stephanie_pink_official auf Instagram und lazytown669 auf Reddit. Weiß nicht, ob sie für ein Video zu haben ist. Kannst sie ja mal fragen.</p>

<p>icemanX, die schöne Sophia muss das ja ganz schön gewirkt haben, dass deine Freundin noch schlanker ist als sie und trotzdem tapferer ist, was die Kälte betrifft.</p>

<p>Martin, es ist super, dass dein Sohn Lisa neue Kleider kauft. Die zu groß gewordenen solltest ihr direkt weggeben, denke ich. Dann gibt es schon keine Entschuldigung mehr, die losgewordenen Pfunde wieder zuzunehmen.</p>

<p>Du spannst uns ja echt auf die Folter. Ich bin echt gespannt, wie Lisa sich in der Kälte geschlagen hat. Kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass sie das einen ganzen Tag durchgestanden hat.</p>

<p>Hi Martin !
Also auf die Fortsetzung von Lisas Geschichte bin ich ja sehr gespannt. Deiner Beschreibung nach ist die sicher hot as hell auch wenn sich ihre Gaensehaut nicht hot anfuehlt. Steh ja generell und nicht nur bei meiner jetzigen Freundin auf dieses cold for beauty-Thema und find es interessant, dass die Meisten, denen das taugt, auch ganz duenne und extrem durchtrainierte Maedels moegen, die fuer ihr Aussehen hungern und sich beim Sport regelrecht quaelen. Na gut, schaut auch besser aus, wenn man die Muskeln zittern sieht und nicht alles schwabbelt wie ein Pudding. Und es ist auch Fakt, dass so eine zarte, ausgehungerte Schneeprinzessin (mir gefaellt der Ausdruck von beauty.takes.sacrifice) mehr friert. Noch spannender ist aber, dass grad diese duennen Frauen, die so leicht frieren, da eher mitspielen als ein Durchschnittsmaedel, auch wenn die viel mehr leiden. Die sind wahrscheinlich wirklich so auf der Suche nach Perfektion und generell so stark und hingebungsvoll, dass die das durchstehen. Sophia ist zwar nicht so extrem wie meine Carina - wohl auch weil ihr Freund da dagegen ist, aber sie ist seit unserem Alpentrip schon auch schlanker geworden und sie bewundert es zumindest, wenn Carina der Kaelte trotzt.
Bin echt gespannt, wie es mit Lisa weitergeht. Videos san super, bei den echten Freundinnen bzw. Schwiegertoechtern aber eben nicht vorhanden ... Kopfkino ist darum eine gute Alternative und ich liebe diese Geschichten auch deshalb, weil sie einen auf gute oder besser gesagt schlechte Ideen bringen. So eine lange Schlittenfahrt mit Minirock, bauchfrei und nackten Schultern und Ruecken muss fuer deine Lisa bei der Kaelte echt brutal gewesen sein. Und dass du sie gewaermt hast, war sicher  fuer sie eine Erholungspause von der Tortur, die sie auch bitter noetig und herbei gesehnt hat. Ich glaub nicht, dass ich meiner Liebsten so einen Ausflug antun moechte, weil der ist schon sehr extrem. Sie wuerde es machen. Sie steht wirklich alles durch. Ihr Mut beeindruckt mich immer wieder. Aber da taete sie mir zu leid. Da wuerde ICH kneifen. Basedrummers Geschichte mit dem Mantel, kommt fuer den naechsten Winter aber sicher auf meine Wishlist. Ein ganzer Tag in Highheels, mit einem duennen Mantel und sonst nix, durch die City (Wald is net so meins) ... tolle Vorstellung. Und das taugt ihr sicher auch. Wenn ihr so kalt ist, dass sie unkontrollierbar zittert, ich ihr die wenigen Klamotten die sie an hat ausziehe, sie nackt und noch mehr frierend da liegt und ich ihren schoenen, schlanken Koerper bewundere, ihr sage wie tapfer sie ist und mit meiner warmen Hand ueber ihre zarte, leicht gebraeunte Gaensehaut streichle, dann dreht sie foermlich durch. Und ich auch. Sie hat mir mal gesagt, dass das schoenste fuer sie ist, wenn sie friert und ich sie waerme. Wenn das Zittern aufhoert und sie sich in meine Arme kuscheln darf, dann ist das fuer sie der totale Kick. Dass Lisas Augen geleuchtet haben, als du sie im Arm gehalten und vor der Kaelte beschuetzt hast, sollte deinem Sohn Sorgen machen. ;-) Bin jetzt nicht der grosse Frauenversteher, aber dass sie in dir wirklich nur einen vaeterlichen Freund sieht, wage ich langsam in Frage zu stellen und ich wuerde mich nicht wundern, wenn das IHR Geburtstagsgeschenk an dich war. Sie geniesst deine koerperliche Naehe und deine Bewunderung offenbar sehr und hat sicher laengst bemerkt, dass sie dir genauso gefaellt und der Aspekt des beschuetzt werdens, den dein Sohn offenbar bei ihr gar nicht beruecksichtigt, zieht sie sicher irgendwann noch mehr in deine Richtung. </p>

<p>Das stimmt, seine Freundin zeigt man natürlich nicht der Öffentlichkeit, da müssen die Geschichten reichen. </p>

<p>Der Wald hatte einfach den Vorteil, dass wir alleine waren und dort dann natürlich alles machen konnten, es war niemand da der uns stören konnte und outdoor Sex im Winter ist nicht zu verachten. Bei meiner ex war es so, dass das genau die richtige Kälte war, sie hat gefroren und gezittert, ihr gesamter Körper hatte eine Gänsehaut, aber sie konnte es gut aushalten und alles auch genießen, das war mit immer sehr wichtig, denn sie hat es für mich getan und nicht weil sie frieren so toll fand.</p>

<p>Eine andere ex von mir war da anders, sie selbst hat gerne gefroren. Auch mit ihr war ich mal im Wald, aber weil sie es wollte, es war ein kick für sie.
Sie hat sich dann dort ausgezogen und auf eine Decke gelegt die ich ausgebreitet hatte. Dann sagte sie mir, "schau mich einfach an" und das tat ich... Ich konnte so sehen wie ihr immer kälter wurde.... Erst nur ein Gänsehaut, dann gelegentlich leichtes Zittern, was immer schneller und heftiger wurde.... Ihre Lippen fingen an zu beben.... Irgendwann sagte sie mir "leg dich zu mir" und natürlich habe ich auch das getan.... Sie wollte Sex während sie friert, waren tolle Zeiten.... </p>

<p>Hallo, entschuldigt bitte, dass ich noch nicht geschrieben habe. Darueber, dass Lisa mehr als einen vaeterlichen Freund in mir sieht, habe ich mir bisher noch keine Gedanken gemacht. Aber wenn ich darüber nachdenke, glaub ich, dass es ihr meine Bewunderung und auch ein wenig körperliche Naehe gut tut und ihr auch hilft die eisige Kaelte auszuhalten. Nun aber zurück zu unserer Ausfahrt. Als wir von unserem Spaziergang zurück kamen, stand unser Schlitten schon bereit. Eine Familie mit zwei kleinen Kindern sass schon auf dem Schlitten. Der Kutscher begruesste uns mit Handschlag und staunte nicht schlecht ,als Lisa ihm ihre zitternde Hand reichte. Doch nicht nur ihre Hand zitterte. Ich stand direkt neben dem Kutscher und konnte Lisa, wie er, von vorn beobachten. Sie zitterte am ganzen Koerper, ihre Beine schlotterteten,dass sie Mühe hatte stehen zu koennen, wir konnten jeden Muskel unter ihrer Gaensehaut zittern sehen. Er begruesste sie mit seiner rechten Hand und legte seine linke Hand auf ihre nackte Schulter:  Maedel, du bist ja eiskalt, hier oben ist Winter, geh und zieh dir schnell etwas über, damit wir starten können. Lisa lächelte ihn an, ihre Zähne klapperten so wild, dass wir sie kaum verstehen konnten: Ich bin fertig. Ist doch herrlicher Sonnenschein, ausserdem hat mein Freund vergessen meine Jacke einzupacken. Wir setzten uns. Der Kutscher brachte uns Decken und konnte seinen Blick nicht mehr von Lisa wenden, die ihren Husten nicht mehr unterdrücken konnte: Maedel, Du hast ja nicht mal Strümpfe an, du holst dir den Tod.  Ich hatte  Angst um sie und bot ihr an, den Ausflug abzubrechen. Mein Sohn fuhr dazwischen: Kommt überhaupt nicht in Frage, ich habe Lisa noch nie in Strümpfen gesehen. Wir hüllten unsere Beine in die Decken. Ich bemerkte gleich, dass das meinem Sohn überhaupt nicht gefiel. Lisa muss aber trotzdem noch unglaublich kalt gewesen sein, immerhin bedeckte ihren Oberkörper nur ein dünnes Trägertop und ich fröstelte schon in meinem Wintermantel. Als für jeden kleine Schnapsflaeschen verteilt wurden, beobachtete ich dass Lisa sie nicht öffnen konnte. Ihre Finger waren so rot und zittrig, dass ich ihr helfen musste. Ich bot ihr gleich noch einen, da sie meinte, dass er sie sich gleich viel wärmer fühlte. Die Kinder der Familie quälten ihre Eltern damit, dass sie frieren würden. Nun kommt der Sadismus ins Spiel von dem ich eigentlich berichten möchte und über den wir hier diskutiert haben. Mein Sohn nahm seine Decke und die von Lisa und gab sie den Kindern. Ihr dürft keinen Schnaps trinken und sollt trotzdem nicht frieren, sagte er zu den beiden. Nun war es aus für Lisa, sie konnte ihren Körper nicht mehr kontrollieren, auch ihren Husten hatte sie nicht mehr im Griff. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass der ganze Schlitten mit Lisa zitterte. Ich machte zwar mir Sorgen, nahm sie wieder in den Arm, flüsterte ihr ins Ohr, dass ich noch nie eine Frau erlebt habe, die sich so sexy in der grössten Kälte zeigt und bot ihr meine Decke an. Sie gab mir die Decke zurück und meinte: Ich brauche wirklich keine Decke, für euch friere ich doch gern mal, aber einen Schnaps nehme ich gerne noch. Ihre Stimme vibrierte förmlich beim Sprechen.  Im nachhinein muss ich zugeben, dass ich es toll fand diese schlanke Frau im Arm zu haben und zu wissen, dass sie für meinen Sohn und vielleicht auch für mich alles zu ertragen bereit ist. Wir waren vielleicht noch eine Stunde unterwegs, ich hatte einerseits Angst um ihre Gesundheit, aber mich faszinierte auch zu beobachten, wie sie immer weiter auskühlt, ihr Körper an seine Grenzen kam, ihre Lippen waren blau und ihre Gänsehaut wurde fast lila und sie trotzdem nicht davon zu überzeugen war aufzugeben und sich wenigstens mit einer Decke etwas zu wärmen. Als wir ankamen zitterte sie fast überhaupt nicht mehr und sie meinte ,dass sie nicht friert. Heute weiss ich, dass das eine beginnende Unterkühlung war, danach waren wir Essen. Im Restaurant fing sie wieder unbeschreiblich zu zittern,   sie konnte kein Glas halten, ohne etwas zu verschütten....
Ich hoffe ihr seid nicht enttäuscht, habe alles ziemlich kurz gefasst, der Kutscher hat sie ziemlich ausgefragt, sie sass auch mal neben ihm und hat die Zügel gehalten, er hat ihr glaub ich gern dabei geholfen....</p>

<p>Hi, bassdrummer.
Also mit einer Freundin, wie deiner zweiten Ex, wuerde wohl jeder gerne im Wald wandern gehen. ;-) 
Einfach frierend dazuliegen, es zu geniessen, dass du sie bewunderst und zu warten, bis du mit ihr schlaefst, wenn sie so friert, dass sie es nicht mehr aushaelt, ist die direkteste Art und ich find die Story extrem sexy. </p>

<p>Hi, Martin.
Danke dir auch sehr fuer deine Geschichte. Wenn Lisa zwischendurch zu zittern aufgehoert hat, dann hat dein Sohn zweifelsohne uebertrieben. Wenn du diese zarte, hungrige Elfe nicht zwischendurch ein bisschen in den Arm genommen und gewaermt haettest, waere sie so ausgekuehlt, dass es auch tatsaechlich haette kritisch werden koennen. Muskelzittern verbraucht extrem viel Energie. Wenn sie mangels Isolierschicht stundenlang zittern muss, um ihre Koerptemperatur zu halten, dann ist sie irgendwann so fertig und ausgepowert, dass der Koerper abschaltet und dann befindet sich die Koerpertemperatur im Sinkflug und wenn du sie dann nicht umgehend aber vorsichtig wieder aufwaermst, kann das kritisch werden. Merk das bei meiner Carina auch immer. Wenn sie immer stiller wird und ihr zittern weniger, muss ich mich um sie kuemmern. Egal wie tough sie ist. Dass Lisa dann im Restaurant wieder mehr gezittert hat, war gut weil sie dadurch wieder auf 'Betriebstemperatur' gekommen ist. Dass du ein bisschen auf sie achtest und sie vor der Kaelte beschuetzt, ist jedenfalls wichtig. Sie war zwar sicher fix und fertig nachher, aber auch maechtig stolz, dass sie das durchgestanden hat fuer euch und ich kann mir vorstellen, dass du und wahrscheinlich alle Maenner in dem Schlitten es nicht einmal bemerkt haettet, wenn Bigfoot neben dem Schlitten hergelaufen waer, weil ihr nur Augen fuer sie hattet. Sie muss - gerade weil sie so extrem abgenommen und trainiert hat, wie du erzaehlt hast - ein unbeschreiblich schoener Anblick gewesen sein. Welche Haarfarbe hat sie eigentlich ? Es gibt jedenfalls nichts erotischeres als ein Maedel mit nackten, muskuloesen aber langen, schlanken Beinen, einem konkaven Waschbrettbauch, sichtbaren Schluesselbeinen und Rippen die von einer Gaensehaut bedeckt ist und zittert. Leider ist es im Moment noch zu warm. Carina sieht zwar immer suess aus und nachdem sie trotz ihrer diversen Abenteuer mit mir ein Frostbeulchen ist, friert sie manchmal auch im Sommer wenn sie zB zu lange im kalten Wasser trainiert, aber ich freue mich trotzdem schon auf den Herbst und den Winter.  </p>

<p>Ja, das war extrem sexy. Sie hat das öfter gemacht, nie so extrem wie in einigen Geschichten hier, aber sie fängt sehr schnell an zu zittern und hat immer dafür Sorge getragen, dass ich das auch merke. 
Es ist leider extrem schwer Frauen zu finden, die sich bei so etwas filmen würden, auch wenn es ja gar nicht nackt sein muss. Sie hat das öfter gemacht, auch als wir auf Terasse saßen. Wenn ihr kalt wurde hat sie sich immer auf meinen Schoß gesetzt und gesagt "lass uns noch etwas hier bleiben"</p>

<p>Hello, yes i have produced 3 shivering videos already, since it is summer i can make only indoor videos with cold water and an air conditioning. I make only neck down shivering videos because for now i have only 1 model who is willing to make cold fetish videos, she is a slim young girl i will try to post a video link of her tonight or at least a picture if i don't find the time.
The model is progressing nicely with cold tolerance and i am looking forward to the coming of colder months and outdoor videos, i am also planning of finding 2 more cold fetish models.</p>

<p>Also, i work on the next basis, you send me 1/3 or half the money before i film the video just so i know you are serious, then i send you the trailer of the made film so you know it is filmed and it is what you wanted, then you send me the rest of the money and i send you the video!</p>

<p>Eine Geschichte fällt mit gerade noch ein.... Es ist lange her, ich muss 17 gewesen sein.... Wir waren in einer Diskothek und eine Klassenkameradin von mir fragte mich, ob wir mal vor die Tür können, sie brauche frische Luft. Sie trug an dem Abend einen Rock und ein Top. Wir haben uns draußen in eine etwas entfernte Bushaltestelle gesetzt. Sie sagte mir noch, dass sie immer schnell anfängt zu zittern wenn ihr frisch wird, kaum ausgesprochen ging es auch los. "Siehst du, das meine ich" sagte sie. Ich habe sie gefragt ob ihr so extrem kalt ist, sie lächelte nur und sagte "ich zittere schnell, kann es aber gut aushalten" wir unterhielten uns eine Weile und inzwischen zitterte die gesamte Bank der Bushaltestelle mit. Ich fand es richtig geil..... Sie fragte mich irgendwann "stört es dich?"
... Was? entgegnete ich. "Das ich so zitter" sagte sie. Natürlich nicht, sollte ich dich wärmen? "Gern" sagte sie und wir blieben noch einige Zeit dort sitzen und ich hatte ihren zitternden Körper im Arm.... Ein schöner Abend </p>

<p>Hi IcemanX und ihr anderen, wollte mich mal wieder melden und berichten, dass Lisa ihre Diät weiter tapfer durchhält und ihre Topfigur bewahren konnte. Ihr Körper hat kaum noch Fett, sie ist von der Sonne braungebrannt und sie zeigt ihre Vorzüge auch gern. Ich habe sie in letzter Zeit nur noch in einem superkurzen Mini und einem total knappen Oberteil gesehen. So kann man wirklich jede einzelne Rippe, ihre sich klar abzeichnenden Schlüsselbeine, Schulterblätter und Hüftknochen bewundern und natürlich ihre schlanken Arme und Beine, unter ihrer Haut ist wirklich kein Fettansatz, sondern nur ein leichter Muskelansatz zu erkennen,kommt wahrscheinlich von ihrem intensiven Training, find ich wirklich sexy. Übrigens hat sie dunkelblonde Haare. Sie schwimmt jeden Tag, auch immer noch quer durch den See, was sie an ihre Grenzen bringt. Ich habe erfahren, dass sie schon mal von einem Paddelboot aus dem See gefischt wurde, weil sie zu erschöpft war das Ufer zu erreichen, wiederholt habe ich versucht sie zu überzeugen am Ufer entlang zu schwimmen, sie meinte aber zu mir, dass sie sich dann nicht so motivieren und auspowern könnte. Ich habe echt Angst um sie, ausserdem raucht sie noch mehr, als früher,wenn wir draußen sind raucht sie nur Kette, sie sagt mir nicht wieviel am Tag, sind aber mehr als zwei Schachteln, sie meinte nur, dass ihr das Rauchen hilft abzunehmen und ihren Stoffwechsel antreibt. Dann gestand sie mir, dass  sie  Angst hat meinen Sohn als Freund zu verlieren, weil er gerade jetzt im Sommer immer den jüngeren Mädchen nachschaut und betont, wie schlank sie sind. Sie hat mich nach einem Geburtstagsgschenk für meinen Sohn gefragt, dass er geil finden würde. Ich habe ihr gesagt,wie toll sie aussieht und dass mein Sohn voll auf Frauen steht, die auch im Winter Haut zeigen und ich keine Frau kenne, die auch nur ansatzweise so sexy in der kälteren Jahreszeit gekleidet sind. Deshalb wäre es für ihn sicher ein geiles Geschenk für seine Freundin die Klamotten aussuchen zu dürfen. Als ich mir bewusst gewurden bin, was ich gesagt habe, plagt mich nun wieder schlechtes Gewissen. Gleichzeitig muss ich zugeben, dass ich hoffe, sie auch ab und zu in der kühleren Jahreszeit zu erleben.Ist total egoistisch von mir und ich schäme mich dafür. Im Nachhinein sagte ich ihr, dass es keine gute Idee war, wenn ich an den letzten Winter denke hat mein Sohn wirklich keine Rücksicht auf Lisa genommen. Doch Lisa war begeistert von meiner Idee, gab mir einen Kuss und umarmte mich und sagte zu mir: Doch, das wird ihm gefallen und ich zeige gern Haut, auch wenn es kühler wird, da muss wirklich keiner Rücksicht nehmen.
Wie geht es Carina? Ich beneide dich, um so eine Freundin. Ich dachte schon Lisa wäre eine Ausnahme, doch Carina und auch die anderen Schneeprinzessinnen sind mindestens genauso hart mit sich selbst. Es ehrt dich, dass du Carina solch eine Schlittenfahrt nicht zugemutet hättest. Ich hätte es auch nicht für möglich gehalten, wie sich die Schlittenfahrt entwickelt hat. Das Lisa immer nackte Beine hat, wusste ich ja. Ich dachte aber mit einer Decke und einer Jacke würde sie sicher trotzdem frieren, aber es vielleicht auch in meinem Arm aushalten. Das mein Sohn sie aber ohne Jacke in die Kälte schickt und ihr dann noch die Decke wegnimmt hätte ich nicht für möglich gehalten. Ich habe trotzdem nichts dagegen unternommen, weil ich zu fasziniert von Lisa war, ihren zitternden schlanken Körper zu beobachte, ich konnte meine Blicke nicht von ihrer Gänsehaut lassen, während ich in meinen Wintersachen fröstelte und sie dann noch meine Decke ablehnte. Interessant war auch, als der Kutscher fragte, ob jemand mal die Zügel halten möchte, sich Lisa sofort meldete und Mühe hatte auf die Kutscherbank zu kommen, weil ihre Beine so stark zitterten und sie die Zügel einfach nicht ruhig halten konnte, weil ihr ganzer Körper sich schüttelte, aber sie  trotzdem mit klappernden Zähnen mit dem Kutscher scherzte. Der Kutscher teilte seine Decke aber nicht mit ihr, sondern legte seine Hand erst auf den schon fast blaugefrorenen Oberschenkel von Lisa, dann auf ihren nackten Rücken und fragte scheinheilig: Deine Gänsehaut ist ja eiskalt,brauchst du wirklich keine Decke, meine Kleine, ist dir nicht zu kalt? Lisa musste wieder husten und  war durch ihr Zittern und Zähneklappern wirklich kaum zu verstehen: Ach nein, ist schon kalt so ohne Jacke, aber wir sind doch gleich da.</p>

<p>Bis bald.</p>

<p>Hi Martin.
Ich gehe jede Wette ein, dass dein Sohn sehr stoffsparend einkaufen und Lisas Durchhaltevermoegen auf eine harte Probe stellen wird.
Kann ihn (und dich) aber gut verstehen. Es ist einfach schoen, wenn eine Frau ganz duenn und durchtrainiert ist und dein blonder, ausgehungerter Engel sieht mit ihren zitternden langen, muskuloesen Beinen und dem gaensehautbedeckten Waschbrettbauch sicher zum Anbeissen aus. Es ist ein Dilemma. Ich moechte zu Carina sicher nicht gemein sein und gefaehrden moechte ich sie schon gar nicht - ich liebe sie naemlich wirklich. Aber ich finde ihre Figur halt super sexy weil sie so mager und durchtrainiert ist und ich finde es aufregend, wenn sie so tapfer friert um mich zu beeindrucken und verfuehrerisch zu sein. Doch soll ich ihr das sagen ? Sie tut es ja um von mir die positive Bestaetigung, die Bewunderung zu bekommen, nach der sie sich sehnt. Genau das macht sie gluecklich. Quaelt sie sich dadurch um so mehr ? Ja. Tut sie es aus Angst, mich sonst zu verlieren ? Who knows. Gerade so perfektionistische Ladies wie sie und Lisa und viele andere dieser hungernden Schneeprinzessinen denken, nie gut genug zu sein. Solange sie aber happy ist und wir happy sind, ist es egal. Das Schwimmen im See ist für Lisa jetzt im September sicher schon sehr hart. Wenn sie froestelnd und mit Gaensehaut in das kalte Wasser steigt, dann kostet sie das sicher viel Ueberwindung. Aber genau das verschafft ihr ein Gefuehl von Staerke, von Ueberlegenheit. Darum hat sie wahrscheinlich keinen Neoprenanzug. Wenn andere Maedels (und auch die Maenner) gar nicht oder nur im Taucheranzug schwimmen, wird sie im Bikini schwimmen und frieren, so sehr fieren. Aber wenn sie bibbernd und zaehneklappernd aus dem Wasser stolpert, sich mit zittrigen, schlanken Fingern durch ihre nassen, blonden Haare streicht und frierend im kalten Wind darauf wartet, bis vielleicht du oder dein Sohn ihr ein Badetuch bringt und so tut, als waere das kein Problem obwohl jede Muskelfaser unter ihrer zarten Haut zittert und sich ihr schoener Koerper nach jedem bisschen Waerme sehnt, dann fuehlt sie sich gut und stark. Wenn sie drei Tage kaum etwas gegessen hat und ihr Magen knurrt und sie so unendlichen großen Hunger hat und sich wieder quaelt und allen Versuchungen widersteht, dann fuehlt sie sich gut und stark. Hab demnaechst eine Reise nach Skandinavien mit Carina geplant. Obwohl sie im Moment eh nur 43 kg hat, trainiert und hungert sie bis sie nicht mehr kann. Hab sie darauf angesprochen. Sie hat mich nur verfuehrerisch angelaechelt und gemeint, sie arbeitet an der Bikinifigur fuer den Urlaub. Sie ist hungrig und weiss, dass es dort oben sehr kalt wird und sie wird trotzdem mit dem Bikini in irgendein eiskaltes Gewaesser huepfen und sie wird sich stark dadurch fuehlen und es geniessen ... und ich auch. ;-)</p>

<p>See ya</p>

<p>Hi IcemanX,
Die Wette wirst du wahrscheinlich gewinnen, mein Sohn wird bestimmt sehr sehr stoffsparend einkaufen und wie ich Lisa kenne wird sie lächelnd die knappen Sachen tragen ,egal wie kalt ihr dabei wird und sich niemals beklagen,dass sie unerträglich friert. Sicher geniesst sie die Bewunderung, aber ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, wie es diese schneeprinzessinnen  schaffen manchmal fast nackt so lange Zeit in der Kälte auszuhalten. Ich kann dich gut verstehen, wenn du von dem Dilemma sprichst, in dem du dich befindest. Es ist einfach ein traumhafter Anblick so eine schlanke durchtrainierte Freundin zu haben und zu erleben, dass sie alles für ihren Freund tut. Es ist gut,dass du dir Gedanken über ihre Gesundheit machst. Aber ich kann gut nachvollziehen, dass du sie auch an ihre Grenzen bringen möchtest. Es ist toll, dass Carina alles für dich tun würde. 43 kg ist wirklich superdünn, möchtest du sie noch schlanker sehen. Würdest du sie verlassen, wenn sie ihr Gewicht nicht mehr halten kann?  Ihr werdet sicher eine geile Zeit in Skandinavien haben. Sie wird im Bikini unglaublich frieren und es gleichzeitig genießen, weil sie weiß, wie sehr dir das gefällt. Bitte pass auf sie auf,dass ihr gesund zurück kommt. Lisa ist wahrscheinlich genauso perfektionistisch, will immer weiter abnehmen und noch mehr trainieren, um meinen Sohn nicht zu verlieren. Deshalb habe ich ja auch so eine Angst um sie. Natürlich trägt sie keinen Neoprenanzug bei ihrem Schwimmtraining. Ich habe die beiden vorgestern am See abgeholt und habe die beiden zu einem Eis eingeladen, sie kam in etwa so aus dem Wasser, wie du es beschrieben hast, bibbernd, völlig erschöpft und zähneklappernd kam sie auf uns zu, fragte uns dabei: Habt ihr das Handtuch mit? Mein Sohn: wieso willst du nicht noch eine Runde schwimmen? Lisa: Ja, ich muss mich nur mal kurz ausruhen. Ich: Lasst uns erst mal ein Eis essen. Mein Sohn: Lasst uns hier draußen bleiben, da muss sich Lisa nicht erst umziehen. Wir setzten uns vor das Restaurant auf eine Sitzgruppe aus Stein. Ich fragte, was sie für ein Eis möchte und sagte ihr, dass ich ihr das Handtuch und trockene Sachen aus dem Auto hole, damit sie sich wenigstens abtrocknen könne, ich betrachtete Lisa, ihre Muskeln zitterten unter ihrer braunen nassen Gänsehaut, aber sie sagte: Du weisst doch, dass ich kein Eis essen darf, aber ich würde gern eine rauchen, danach schwimme ich noch eine Runde, da muss ich mich nicht erst abtrocknen. Ich habe nicht widersprochen, war gemein von mir, und die Zeit mit ihr genossen. 
Martin </p>

<p>Hi, Martin.
Das was mir gefällt, ist es, wenn eine Frau einen möglichst geringen Fettanteil hat und ein bisschen muskuloes ist, also zart und drahtig. Carina ist mit 43 kg da eh schon am Limit. Fett hat sie nicht mehr und wenn sie noch duenner waere, wuerde sie nur noch Haut und Knochen sein, was ich erstens nicht so schoen finde wie ihren leichten Muskelansatz und zweitens ungesund waere. Ausserdem quaelt sie sich eh genug, um ihre Figur zu halten. Ich denke, dass sie leicht zunehmen wuerde, wenn sie nicht so diszipliniert Diaet halten und so hart trainieren wuerde. Ob ich sie dann verlassen wuerde ? Huh, Gewissensfrage !
Also, wenn sie zunimmt wegen einer Krankheit, dann nein. Hab sie gern, bin selbst auch nicht schlank und auch wenn sie mir nicht mehr so gefallen wuerde, so ist es ja nicht ihre Entscheidung. Wenn sie sich aber nur schleifen laesst, weil es ihr egal ist, waere es aber wahrscheinlich anders. Die Antwort klingt jetzt vielleicht echt fies, aber ... ihr Aussehen ist ein wesentlicher Teil dessen, was mich an ihr fesselt und dass sie das alles fuer mich tut und so tapfer, hingebungsvoll und - ja - nennen wir es ruhig leidensfaehig ist, ist fuer mich der ultimative Liebesbeweis. Das hat viel mit SM zu tun, hab ich schon mal gesagt und dabei bleib ich und auch dabei, dass das alles hier eine SM-Spielvariante ist: das hungern genauso wie das frieren. Aber sowohl deine Lisa, wie auch Carina und die anderen Girls hier im Forum stehen darauf, machen das freiwillig und auch wir sind mit ihnen freiwillig zusammen weil wir darauf stehen. Also, wenn du eine kurze, ehrliche Antwort willst: wenn sie zunimmt weil es ihr egal ist und nur mit Schlabber-Pulis rumlaeuft, dann ja. Wichtig ist, das niemand zu Schaden kommt und jeder happy ist. Lisa ist nass, fast nackt und zitternd auf dem Stein gekauert und hat euch hungrig zu geschaut, wie ihr euer Eis genossen habt und nochmals in das eiskalte Wasser zu gehen, obwohl ihr eh schon so schrecklich kalt war, muss fuer das zarte Maedchen echt hart gewesen sein. Oberflaechlich betrachtet war also dein Schweigen tatsaechlich gemein. ABER: dass sie sich ueberwunden hat, ihr sie dafuer bewundert habt, dein Sohn sie vielleicht zuhause dann gewaermt hat und sie sich stark und geliebt fuehlt ... das ist ein solcher Kick fuer sie, dass sie es macht. Egal wie sehr sie dadurch koerperlich leidet. Weil sie happy ist dadurch. Sie ist nicht zu Schaden gekommen, sie war happy, dein Sohn war happy und du auch. Triple Jackpot ! :-)</p>

<p>@beauty.takes.sacrifice. Thank you a lot for that link that gives all pages in one with fixed German characters. I can understand German a bit but it's not enough and I have to use machine translation to translate them to English. Those characters were a struggle for me but your link saved me lot's of time :).</p>

<p>Thank you to all other. Especially Martin and iceman. I really like reading your stories :) Do you guys understand english? Or should I translate my messages to German?</p>

<p>@dreamproducer Thanks for sharing a video. I think they aren't resistant enough yet. Not physically but mentally. I'm sure they both could stay in the water much longer :)</p>

<p>Hi IcemanX, 
Danke für deine Antwort, du hast mein schlechtes Gewissen zumindest etwas beruhigt, wahrscheinlich sind Lisa und mein Sohn Happy in ihrer Beziehung. Lisa geniesst die Herausforderung meinem Sohn seine Wünsche zu erfüllen, je mehr ich darüber nachdenke, desto mehr muss ich dir Recht geben, dass eine SM Variante in ihre Beziehung spielt. Und ehrlich gesagt, geniesse ich es regelrecht ein wenig daran teilzuhaben, gerade jetzt wenn es langsam kälter wird, Lisa zu beobachten, wie diese zarte Prinzessin alles gibt ihre geile Figur zu behalten und sie auch zu zeigen. 
Ich kann dich gut verstehen und finde dich sehr ehrlich , dass du zugibst deine Carina zu verlassen, wenn sie sich gehen lassen würde. Aber keine Sorge, deine Carina liebt dich viel zu sehr, um dich zu enttäuschen. Sie muss die perfekte Figur haben. Hattet ihr eine schöne Zeit in Skandinavien? Konnte sie ihr Gewicht halten und hat sie es geschafft ihren tollen Körper in der skandinavischen Kälte in knappen Klamotten zu präsentieren? Wie haben die anderen auf sie reagiert?
Ich habe Lisa bei einer negativen Erfahrung erlebt, wir waren auf einer Grillparty, Lisa hat natürlich dort nichts gegessen, nur geraucht und den Männern mit ihrer nackten Gänsehaut den Kopf verdreht. Nach etwas zu viel Alkohol hat sie die Gastgeber in heftig beleidigt. Aber Lisa hat cool reagiert und gemeint, dass sie gern für ihren Freund auf ihren Körper achtet.

<p>Hallo Martin.
Wenn deine Lisa so eine perfekte Figur hat, fuer die sie merklich hungert und bis zur Erschoepfung Sport macht und auch tapfer genug ist, trotz Gaensehaut und Zittern ihren schoenen Koerper fuer ihren Freund in Szene zu setzen, dann zieht das den Neid der anderen Frauen auf sich. Es behaupten zwar viele, dass sie fuer ihren Mann oder Freund ALLES tun wuerden, aber im realen Leben sind Maedels, die so hingebungsvoll, tapfer, mutig und stark sind,  wie deine Lisa oder meine Carina trotzdem die Ausnahme. Darum reagieren auch typischerweise Frauen - wie diese Gastgeberin - so eifersuechtig. Sie traueumt sicher genauso davon, einen Koerper wie Lisa zu haben und von allen bewundert zu werden, ist aber dann wuetend auf sich selbst, weil sie den hohen Preis dafuer nicht zahlen will und kann. Lisa war sicher - wie wahrscheinlich eh immer - sehr hungrig und dass sie sogar auf der Grillparty standhaft geblieben ist, zeigt wie stark sie ist und wie sehr sie deinen Sohn liebt, dass sie sich so fuer ihn kasteit. Dass sie mit ihrer superschlanken Figur und ihrer Gaensehaut den Maennern und wahrscheinlich auch dem Mann der Gastgeberin den Kopf verdreht hat ist logisch. Und das war fuer die Gastgeberin dann wahrscheinlich Eifersuchtsgrund pur.  Maenner reagieren auf Carina immer fasziniert, manchmal scheinbar besorgt, aber trotzdem fasziniert ... es sind auch bei ihr immer die Frauen, die negativ reagieren. Meistens ist aber auch der Grund, dass so zarte, ausgehungerte Elfen wie Lisa oder meine Freundin, wenn sie trotz Kaelte viel Haut zeigen bei den Maennern so die Hormone ueberkochen lassen (geht uns ja nicht anders), dass sie ihre Partnerinnen meist komplett ignorieren und nur noch Augen fuer unsere frierenden Hungerkuenstlerinnen haben, sodass die anderen Damen natuerlich ausflippen.
Hab das auch wieder in Norwegen gesehen. Da hab ich allerdings meine Freundin an ihre Grenzen gepusht, aber sie hat es letztlich extrem genossen und ich auch, obwohl ich schon zugeben muss, dass ich diesmal extra fies zu ihr war.
Wir haben uns ueber 3 Wochen vor  unserem Urlaub nicht gesehen, weil wir beide viel um die Ohren hatten und waren schon extrem heiss aufeinander, speziell weil sie durch das intensive Training, das sie immer absolviert, fuer ihren Geschmack zu viel an Muskel aufgebaut hatte und darum nun seit Wochen zusaetzlich extrem Diaet gehalten hat, weil sie zwar weiter einen fettlosen und drahtigen Körper aber weniger Muskelmasse wollte. Ich bin zwar schon immer besorgt, wenn sie so extrem wird, vor allem weil sie sich echt quaelt und leidet, muss aber zugeben, dass ich so zarte Frauen mag. Ich finde es sexy, wenn ein Maedchen durchtrainiert ist, aber nicht aussieht wie einen Bodybuilderin. Ausserdem ist Carina, wenn sie hungrig ist, immer besonders anschmiegsam ;-).
Wir haben uns eine kleine, aber luxurioese Huette genommen, wobei sie bei der Anreise wiedermal kraeftig rumgesponnen hat ... ihre Flugangst, ihr Heimweh und dass ihr bei Autofahrten schlecht wird, ist eine ihrer weniger guten Eigenschaften. Sie rollt sich dann wie eine kleine Katze, mit finsterer Miene im Sitz des Flugzeugs oder Autos zusammen und redet nichts bzw. nur von Flugzeugabsturz oder dass sie Magenschmerzen hat, wobei es in diesem Zusammenhang nicht hilfreich ist, dass sie ueberhaupt nichts gegessen hat, den ganzen Tag. Ich habe also beschlossen, dass ich sie fuer das Rumgezicke etwas zappeln lasse. God knows, dass es mir ungemein schwer gefallen ist, da wir uns eben so lange nicht gesehen hatten und sie es darauf angelegt hatte, mich zu verfuehren: Obwohl es in der Huette noch relativ kalt war und Carina offenbar laenger unter der kalten Dusche gestanden hatte, kroch sie nicht zu mir unter die Decke sondern lag ausgestreckt da und knoepfte mit - teils vor Aufregung, teils vor Kaelte - zittrigen Fingern mein Hemd auf, das sie sich als Nachthemd ausgeborgt hatte, obwohl sie darin locker 4x hineingepasst haette. Im Halbdunkel des Zimmers haben sich die Konturen ihres Koerpers wunderschoen als Schatten abgezeichnet und es war auch deutlich zu sehen, dass sie eine Gaensehaut hatte. Ich war hin und her gerissen. Das wochenlange hungern trotz ihres harten Trainings hat auf ihren Koerper zweifelsfrei einen Effekt gehabt. Sie war immer extrem duenn mit einem niedrigen Koerperfettanteil, aber jetzt mit 43 kg (wenn sie die ueberhaupt noch hatte) wirkte sie extrem zerbrechlich. Sie ist jetzt bei weitem kein Knochengeruest, ihre Muskel sind perfekt proportioniert, sie ist drahtig, zart und durchtrainiert, ohne Fett, aber man sieht ihr auch an, dass sie hungert. Ihre Rippen waren nicht nur spuerbar sondern deutlich sichtbar und die Haut ueber ihren Bauchmuskeln war so duenn, dass man die Muskelfasern ihres Sixpacks spueren konnte.  Ihre Bauch war, obwohl sie ihn nicht eingezogen hat, so tief eingesunken, dass man die Wirbelsaeule spueren konnte. Ihre Hueftknochen, die Schluesselbeine  und die Rippen beim Brustbein zeichneten sich perfekt ab und ihre muskuloesen, schlanken Beine hatten nun seitlich zwischen den Muskeln, eine Rinne, die ich so schoen finde. 'Es war echt hart. Ich habe weiter trainiert und bin jeden Abend hungrig schlafen gegangen. Aber ich habe mich so nach dir gesehnt und fuer dich mache ich alles. Gefaellt dir meine Figur ?' Ich haette ihr gerne gesagt, dass sie der schoenste Anblick ist, den ein Mann sich wuenschen kann und sie leidenschaftlich geliebt. Aber ich wollte sie auf die Folter spannen, auch wenn ich selbst am explodieren war. Ich hob zaertlich die Haut neben ihrem Nabel hoch und meinte nur ausweichend: 'Du weisst, dass es mir gefaellt, wenn du ganz duenn, durchtrainiert und ausgehungert bist.' Ich merkte, dass sie meine kuehle Antwort verunsicherte. Ich streichelte mit der Hand ueber ihren eingesunkenen Waschbrettbauch der so heftig knurrte, dass Carina zusammen zuckte. 'Tut es weh ?' Sie sah mich mit ihren grossen, dunklen Augen an, nickte, doch ich merkte, wie sehr sie mein zaertliches Streicheln genossen hat und wie sehr sie mehr wollte und sich nach Anerkennung und Zuwendung sehnte. Je laenger ich sie streichelte um so mehr begann sie zu zittern. Ob es nun ihre Leidenschaft oder die Kaelte war oder wahrscheinlich beides: ihre Brustwarzen, die ich vorsichtig anknabberte waren steinhart und ihre schlanken Oberschenkel waren von einer Gaensehaut bedeckt. Ich spuerte, wie jede Faser ihres schlanken Koerpers sich anspannte. 'Frierst du ?' 'Ja, sehr !'. Ich nahm die zweite Decke, deckte sie zu und meinte nur knapp: 'Na, dann deck dich zu und waerm dich auf. Damit du dich nicht verkuehlst. Schlaf gut.' Ich drehte mich um und hoerte nur ihr verzweifeltes aufstoehnen und dass sie offenbar zornig die Decke auf den Boden pfefferte. Ich weiss nicht wie lange sie frierend und zitternd neben mir gelegen ist. Sie kuschelte sich zwar irgendwann zu mir, ist aber nicht zu mir unter die Decke geschluepft. Nachdem ihr Zaehneklappern und ihr Zittern immer heftiger wurde, habe ich sie irgendwann dann zugedeckt und gewaermt, wobei sie zwar tat, als wuerde sie schlafen, aber ich an ihrem schnellen Herzschlag gemerkt hat, wie sehr sie sich nach noch mehr Naehe gesehnt hat. </p>

<p>Am naechsten Tag war sie bereits im Morgengrauen aufgestanden, war zwei Stunden laufen und hatte mir Fruehstueck gemacht. Obwohl sie am Vortag keinen Bissen gegessen hatte und ihre Augen verrieten wie extrem hungrig sie war, trank sie nur ihren Tee. Sie wirkte nach der Nacht total unsicher und fahrig. 'Hunger ?' 'Ja, schon. Aber ich muss heute noch fasten. Wenn ich wirklich ganz duenn und durchtrainiert sein will, dann muss ich mich noch ein bisschen quaelen. Wir fahren heute ohnedies in der Gegend rum. Da merk ich den Hunger nicht so sehr ... ja, es tut weh, manchmal sehr, aber ... ich tu alles fuer dich, weisst du ... ich brauche dich, sehne mich nach deiner Naehe ... ich halte alles aus, Hunger oder Kaelte ... aber bitte lieb mich.' </p>

<p>Ich weiss, dass das alles megagemein war, aber ich habe es genossen und ich wusste, dass sie es am Ende auch geniessen wuerde. Und natuerlich hatte ich ob dieser Liebeserklaerung ein schlechtes Gewissen.</p>

<p>Wir sind jedenfalls den ganzen Tag mit unserem Miet-SUV herum gefahren und machten auf dem Rueckweg zu unserer Huette an einer kleinen Bucht halt, an der es sogar einen Sandstrand gab. Wenn es nicht regnerisch und so eiskalt gewesen waere, haette man sich an die Karibik erinnert gefuehlt. Carina hatte ihre Laufschuhe, knielange Sporthosen, ein T-Shirt und eine duenne Windjacke an und froestelte im kalten Wind. Wir gingen zu diesem Strand hinunter und sahen einen VW-Bus mit deutschen Kennzeichen, der am Rand geparkt war. Der VW-Bus gehoerte einem gewissen Mike aus der Naehe von Hamburg, der mit seiner Freundin Silke durch die Gegend fuhr und offenbar versucht hatte, ein bisschen zu surfen. Wir kamen rasch ins Gespraech, doch waehrend Mike ein cooler Typ war, begann es zwischen Carina und Silke sofort zu krachen. Mike meinte, dass er nicht mehr surfen wuerde, weil die Wellen zu flach sind. 'Und wie ist das Wasser ?' Ich mass Carinas Interesse an der Wassertemperatur zunaechst keine Bedeutung zu, da sie in ihren duennen Sportklamotten im eiskalten Wind zu zittern begonnen hat und ihre Haende schon jetzt eiskalt waren. 'Das hat nur ein paar Grad. Aber ich habe einen super Thermoanzug, der isoliert auch im Winter.' 'Und was ist mit dir ? Surfst du auch ?' 'Noe, das ist was fuer harte Maenner. Ich habe zwar auch einen Wetsuit, aber mir ist auch damit zu kalt.' Silke war offenbar durch den Umstand irritiert, dass Mike die Augen nicht mehr von Carina lassen konnte. Mike fragte sie, ob sie viel Sport machen wuerde.  Carina erzaehlte, dass sie viel laufen, schwimmen und Muskelaufbautraining machen wuerde. Sie zog ihre Jacke und ihr T-Shirt hoch: 'ich will fuer meinen Freund ja gut aussehen.' 'Tolle Bauchmuskel, du bist eine extrem schlanke und durchtrainierte Frau. Toll. Kannst echt stolz sein.' Mikes Kompliment kam bei Silke, die eher pummelig war, gar nicht gut an. 'Seit wann stehst du auf Hungerhacken ?' Und zu Carina: 'Wenn du statt dem Training was essen wuerdest, waer ein bisschen mehr dran an dir. Dann waer dir auch nicht so leicht kalt, mit ein paar cm Isolierschicht.' Mir schwante langsam, was Carina vor hatte und meine Spannung stieg. 'Wir koennen ja ausprobieren, wer es laenger im Wasser aushaelt. Du im Neoprenanzug oder ich nur im Bikini. Auch wenn ich wirklich einen extrem geringen Koerperfettanteil habe und natuerlich mit Muskelzittern gegen die Unterkuehlung ankaempfen muss, bin ich hart genug, das auszuhalten. Unsere Maenner haben sicher nichts dagegen uns nachher aufzuwaermen.' Sie sah mich mit gluehenden Augen an und ich wusste, dass egal wie sehr sie jetzt schon fror und sich vor der Kaelte fuerchtete, sie eine Show hinlegen wollte, um mich zu verfuehren und dort anzuknuepfen, wo wir am Vorabend aufgehoert hatten. 'Kannst dir gerne eine Lungenentzuendung holen. So mager wie du bist, haeltst du keine 10 Minuten durch. Du schlotterst jetzt schon.' Mike sah mich ratlos an. Man merkte deutlich, dass er diesen Wettkampf extrem geil gefunden und meine Freundin nur zu gerne im Bikini gesehen haette. Er stotterte herum: 'es ist sehr kalt ... bist echt mutig ... hast einen echt schoenen Koerper ... aber du wuerdest sehr frieren ... du bist schon sehr duenn ...'
Carina warf mir einen herausfordernden Blick zu: 'Versprichst du, mich zu hause dann aufzuwaermen ?'. Mein Herz schlug bis zum Hals. Die Vorstellung, dass meine ausgehungerte, frierende Elfe zitternd in das eiskalte Wasser springen wuerde turnte mich extrem an, gleichzeitig machte es mich unruhig, dass sie gleich so extrem leiden wuerde und ich sie zumindest zum Teil dorthin gepusht hatte. Mike huepfte nervoes von einem Bein aufs andere und Silke schimpfte nur vor sich hin.
Als Carina vom Auto zurueck kam - siehe hatte dort zufaellig ;-) einen Bikini gefunden - bibberte sie bereits vor Kaelte. Sie war barfuß, ihre schlanken Beine waren marmoriert mit einer Gaensehaut und ihre langen, schwarzen Haare waren vom Regen feucht. Ihre Lippen bebten leicht und ihr kleiner, knackiger Arsch zitterte merklich. Ich nahm sie kurz in den Arm: 'Heute musst du mich waermen, sonst erfriere ich ...'. Mike war total aus dem Haeuschen: 'Du hast ja wirklich kein Fett. Du zitterst ja jetzt schon. Du bist eine so schoene Frau, wie ein Topmodel ... du musst das nicht tun ... ich meine, es waer schon extrem mutig und sexy, aber ...'. Ich half ihr aus der Jacke. Ihr lief auf den  Schultern, Armen und am Bauch sofort die Gaensehaut auf und jeder Windstoss lies sie zittern. Ihre Brustwarzen waren hart und ihre Zaehne klapperten, als sie mich leidenschaftlich kuesste. Sie sprintete los und tauchte in den eiskalten Wellen unter. 'Mensch, du hast so viel Glueck. Deine Freundin ist eine Goettin ... so schlank, so muskuloes, so tapfer ...' Nun, war es fuer Silke zu viel: 'Erstens, die hat nur Haut und Knochen, zweitens ist die voll Masochistin und kann von mir aus erfrieren und drittens seit ihr zwei verdammte Ars....loecher !!!!' Sie stuermte zu ihrem Bus, doch Mike haette es nicht einmal gekuemmert, wenn sie damit weggefahren waere, denn Carina kam nun nach etwa 10 Minuten aus dem Wasser gestolpert.  Das nur wenige Grad kalte Wasser hatte ihrem fettlosen Koerper die gesamte Waerme entzogen und sie fror wie die Hoelle. Obwohl sie wirklich blau war, ihre Zaehne so klapperten, dass sie nicht einmal sprechen konnte und ihre Haende so zitterten, dass sie es kaum schaffte ihre Haare nach hinten zu streichen, schlenderte sie langsam Richtung unseres Auto. 'Na, war Silke der Wind zu kalt ?'. Sie zwinkerte Mike an, dessen Hormone foermlich aus seinen Ohren dampften. Ich verabschiedete mich von ihm und folgte meiner Freundin zum Auto. Ich hatte erwartet, dass sie sich abgetrocknet und angezogen hatte und war regelrecht schockiert, dass sie bei offenem Fenster und noch immer nur im Bikini zitternd am Beifahrersitz kauerte. Jetzt war ich es der herumstotterte: 'Du frierst ganz schrecklich ... zieh dich an und ich dreh die Heizung an ...'. 'Nein. Das Zittern verbrennt Kalorien, schau ...' Sie strich mit ihren blaugefrorenen, zitternden, schlanken Fingern ueber ihren ebenso heftig zitternden, gaensehautbedeckten, flachen Bauch und vergrub ihre Haende schließlich zwischen ihren schlotternden, schlanken Oberschenkeln. Sie warf mir einen sehnsuechtigen Blick zu und versuchte trotz ihrer klappernden Zaehne mich verfuehrerisch anzulaecheln. 'Bring mich nach Hause, ich brauche Waerme, deine Waerme ...'. Ich glaube, ich habe jede norwegische Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung ueberschritten, die es gibt und mehr sie angestarrt, als auf die Strasse geschaut. Sie weigerte sich, sowohl das Fenster zu schliessen, als auch die Heizung aufzudrehen und der Fahrtwind kuehlte ihren nackten, nassen Koerper noch weiter aus. Ich versuchte sie mit meiner warmen Hand etwas zu waermen, doch sie zitterte immer heftiger. Als wir bei der Huette waren, hob ich sie aus dem Auto und trug sie, da ihre Fuesse von der Kaelte ganz blau waren. Sie riss sich den nassen Bikini vom Koerper und stand blaugefrorenen und zitternd vor mir. 'Du musst noch das Salzwasser abwaschen. Ich zitter so, dass ich das nicht ohne Hilfe schaffe ...' Ich versuchte an der Dusche eine warme Temperatur einzustellen, doch Carina drehte, obwohl ihre Haende zitterten, das Wasser auf eiskalt. 'Du hast mich gestern extrem gequaelt', meinte sie mit klappernden Zaehnen, 'dann mach jetzt auch weiter....' Das kalte Wasser ueber ihren frierend Koerper laufen zu lassen war ein absoluter Thrill. Natuerlich war es eine Tortur fuer sie,aber ich liess sie nur kurz so leiden, denn ich wollte sie und ich wollte ihr die Zuwendung geben, fuer die sie das alles auf sich genommen hatte. Ich trocknete sie hastig ab und trug sie ins Bett. Ihre Haut war eiskalt und fuehlte sich durch die Gaensehaut wie Samt an. Ihre Brustwarzen waren so hart, dass sie damit Glas haette schneiden koennen. 'Du bist so schoen, so perfekt, so schlank und ausgehungert und so tapfer ...' Ich streichelte ihren zitternden Koerper und spuerte, wie sich jeder Muskel zusammenkrampfte. Sie krallte sich leidenschaftlich an mir fest. Ich versuchte sie zuzudecken und zu waermen, doch sie war so in Fahrt, dass ihr die Kaelte egal zu sein schien. Im Gegenteil: je mehr sie zitterte und je mehr ich ihr sagte, wie hungrig sie war und wie sehr sie friert, um so leidenschaftlicher wurde sie. Es turnt sie immer total an, wenn ich ihr sage, dass sie leidet und sie dafuer bewundere. Norwegen war toll. Dieser Ausflug war aber eindeutig das Beste.</p>

<p>Apropos schwimmen im kalten Wasser: traut sich Lisa noch in den See ? Wenn sie jetzt im Oktober noch laenger schwimmt, nimmt sie wenigstens jetzt einen Neoprenanzug ?. Das Meer in Norwegen ist zwar noch deutlich kaelter, aber Carina war ja nur 10 Minuten im Wasser. Wenn Lisa keine Fettschicht hat und nur im Badeanzug oder gar im Bikini schwimmt, dann ist es sicher extrem kalt fuer sie. Sie verbrennt durch das Zittern zwar extrem viele Kalorien und haertet sich auch fuer die Torturen ab, die dein Sohn ihr auferlegt, aber das ist trotzdem sehr hart fuer sie. Turnt es sie eigentlich auch an, wenn ihr ihr sagt, dass sie hungrig ist und wenn ihr sie bewundert, weil sie so tapfer friert oder sagt dein Sohn ihr das gar nicht ? Waermt er sie, wenn sie zB nach dem Schwimmtraining friert oder laesst er sie einfach zittern bzw. pusht sie noch weiter ? Versuchst du,  sie ein bisschen zu waermen, damit sie nicht gar so friert ?
Bei Carina ist es die Mischung aus Bewunderung fuer ihre Haerte wenn ihr kalt ist bzw. ihre Disziplin wenn sie hungert und das aufwaermen. Wenn sie friert und ich waerme sie mit 6 auf, dann ist das fuer sie das Groesste.</p>

<p>Hallo! ich benutze google translate, also wird dieses deutsch wahrscheinlich ein bisschen seltsam sein.
Ich lese gerne Geschichten von martin99 und dir icemanx und schreibe dir, weil ich dich fragen möchte, ob du daran interessiert bist, ein kaltes Video mit deinen Freundinnen zu machen, die bereit sind, erstaunlich kalte Dinge zu tun. Ich würde für das Video bis zu 500 USD bezahlen, basierend auf dem, was das Video ist. Auch andere Leute aus dem Forum können Sie für das gleiche Video bezahlen, so dass der Preis höher sein kann. Ich glaube, wir alle teilen die gleiche Liebe zur Kälte und sollten sie teilen. Natürlich werde ich selbst das Video nicht posten oder teilen, da es privat ist. Ich würde gerne Ihre Gedanken zu dieser Idee hören. Sowohl martin99 als auch icemanx</p>

<p>Hi, dreamproducer.
Du kannst gerne meine Geschichten als Drehbuchvorlage verwenden, für das Video selbst, musst du dir aber leider ein professionelles Model suchen. Ich finde so zarte aber harte Maedels, die wie die Hoelle frieren, um ihre Maenner und ihre sonstige Umgebung zu beeindrucken, schon immer extrem sexy und nachdem ich nun das Riesenglueck habe, dass sich so eine Schneeprinzessin Hals ueber Kopf in mich verliebt hat, teile ich halt Episoden aus unserem (Liebes)leben, weil ich ja selbst solche Geschichten auch gerne lese. Aber: Wir sind eben zwei reale Personen, mit einem Alltag, einem Beruf, in einer realen Beziehung und ich erzaehl nur deshalb so freizuegig ueber die Dinge, die zwischen uns laufen, weil das hier anonym moeglich ist. Meine Liebste ist zwar extrem huebsch und sexy, aber kein professionelles (Erotik)modell. Sie tut das fuer mich, tut das, weil sie sich offenbar stark und sexy fuehlt dadurch, aber sie wuerde ausflippen, wenn ich ihr vorschlagen wuerde, ein Video fuers Internet zu drehen. Und ich will von ihr eigentlich auch nicht mehr teilen, als Beschreibungen und Storys.  Ich veroeffentliche darum auch keine Photos von ihr oder eigene Videos. Zu erzaehlen, was sie fuer mich tut, ist das Maximum was ich an Privatheit preisgeben moechte. Darum wird es ausser Geschichten auch nie mehr geben. Sorry. </p>

<p>Hi Iceman,</p>

<p>so gerne ich ein Video von deiner hübschen Frau sehen würde, so sehr kann ich deine Entscheidung nachvollziehen nichts der gleichen zu veröffentlichen. Es ist allerdings sehr schwer Models zu finden die für ein Video bereit sind. Solange du aber ab und zu Geschichten aus eurem Alltag erzählst ist das schon mehr als man verlangen kann und sehr sexy, wenn auch manchmal kaum zu glauben. ;-)</p>

<p>Liebe Grüße </p>

<p>Hi, dreamproducer,
ich kann mich IcemanX nur anschlieÂÂÂÂen, Lisa wÂÂÂÂ¼rde es mir nie verzeihen, wenn ich ich Fotos oder Videos weiter verkaufen wÂÂÂÂ¼rde. Sie ist bereit alles fÂÂÂÂ¼r ihren Freund zu tun, aber sich niemals verkaufen. Die beiden wissen auch nicht, dass ich hier schreibe. Ich bin eigentlich aus grosser Sorge um Lisa hier her gekommen, da es sehr schwierig ist sich mit meinen Freunden darÂÂÂÂ¼ber auszutauschen. Meist ist es einfach so, dass die MÂÂÂÂ¤nner Lisa toll finden und die Frauen zickig und eifersÂÂÂÂ¼chtig auf sie reagieren, aber nicht verstehen und erkennen wie diszipliniert und perfektionistisch Lisa die Vorlieben meines Sohnes umsetzt und doch selbst tiefe Befriedigung in der Bewunderung fÂÂÂÂ¼r ihre perfekte Figur und ihr DurchhaltevermÂÂÂÂ¶gen findet.

<p>Hi IcemanX,
Dein Urlaub in Norwegen mit Carina muss unglaublich toll gewesen sein, Carina ist für dich bis an ihre Grenzen gegangen und du hast sie anfangs ziemlich hingehalten, aber später hast du sie umso mehr verwöhnt. Ich wäre gern an der Stelle von diesem Mike gewesen und hätte deine Carina bei ihrem Bad beobachtet, so wie du sie beschreibst hat sie für mich die perfekte Figur, sie dann zu erleben, wie sie mit knurrendem Magen zitternd und zähneklappernd aus dem eiskalten Wasser kommt und so selbstverständlich im nassen Bikini bleibt muss Mike um den Verstand gebracht haben. Kein Wunder dass er keine Augen für seine Freundin mehr hatte. Du pushst Carina wirklich an ihre Grenzen, ich hätte Angst, dass sie übertreibt. Carina hat am Ende deine zärtlichen Behandlung am Ende aber für alles entschädigt und es war für euch ein unvergessliches Erlebnis.Hat sich Carina erkältet. Lisa ist fast den ganzen Winter hindurch erkältet gewesen. Und auch jetzt ist sie schon wieder stark erkältet, was mir große Sorgen macht. Sie gibt es nicht so richtig zu und schiebt ihren starken Husten immer aufs Rauchen.
Trotzdem trainiert Lisa immer noch fast täglich im See, natürlich im Bikini ,obwohl das Wasser jetzt schon empfindlich kühl ist und sie wirklich lange im Wasser bleibt. Ich glaube es turnt sie schon ziemlich an, wenn ich ihr meine Bewunderung zeige. Ich sage ihr dann, wie perfekt ich ihren Körper finde, streichel über ihre zitternde Gänsehaut und kann ihre zitternden Muskeln fühlen und ihren knurrenden Magen hören. Mein Sohn nimmt es als selbstverständlich hin, dass sie sich für ihn quält und pusht sie immer weiter. Wenn ich sie einlade nach dem Training etwas zu essen oder ihren nassen zitternden Körper wenigstens mit einem Handtuch etwas Wärme zu gönnen, meint er meist: Lisa schwimm lieber noch eine Runde, das kann nur gut für deine Figur sein. Ich versuche sie dann manchmal zu überzeugen, dass sie schon genug trainiert hat und sich auch mal aufwärmen muss. Sie küsst mich dann mit ihren blauen Lippen auf die Wange und flüsterte mir mit klappernden Zähnen ins Ohr: Danke, wie lieb von dir, aber du hörst ja, ich muss noch etwas für meine Figur tun. Auch nach einer weiteren Runde im kalten Wasser, gab er ihr vor zwei Wochen keine Gelegenheit sich aufzuwärmen, es war gegen Abend schon ziemlich kalt, vielleicht 8 Grad, sagte er : Lasst uns auf ein Bier zu meinem Kumpel Marcus gehen. Er hat einen Garten ganz in der Nähe. So gingen wir direkt dorthin. Ich versuchte meinen Sohn zu überzeugen, dass sich Lisa abtrocknen und umziehen muss. Er meinte nur: Wir bleiben doch nicht lange. Ich bemerkte,wie schwer es Lisa fiel, vollkommen erschöpft,hungrig und barfuß im nassen Bikini mit uns zu laufen. Trotzdem begrüsste sie freudig Marcus mit einer Umarmung. Er machte ihr Komplimente und meinte: Oh Gott, du hast einen so durchtrainierten Körper, aber du musst dich schnell umziehen, ich hole dir ein Handtuch und einen dicken Pulli, du bist ja nass und eiskalt und zitterst am ganzen Körper. Lisa sehnte sich nach Wärme, schaute zu meinem Sohn und sah an seinen Augen, dass ihn das enttäuschen würde und lehnte das Angebot ab. Dabei war sie kaum zu verstehen, da sie ihren Husten nicht mehr unterdrücken konnte und ihre Zähne mehr als klapperten: Nein, bleib hier, ich bin gern im Bikini, er ist im Wind schon fast trocken. Dabei strich sie ihre nassen Haare aus dem Gesicht, ihre Muskeln zitterten unter ihrer Gänsehaut und sie hatte Mühe zu stehen, weil sie ihre Beine nicht mehr kontrollieren konnte. Sie setzte sich zwischen mich und Marcus auf die Gartenschaukel und fragte Marcus, ob er ihr Feuer geben könnte.Jetzt bebte die ganze Schauckel. So konnte Marcus ihr die ganze Zeit ihre Zigarretten anzünden, da sie das mit ihren zitternden Händen kaum halten konnte. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich immer wieder einen Grund gesucht habe, sie in den Arm zu nehmen, um ihre Gänsehaut zu berühren und auch Marcus hat sie immer wieder rein zufällig berührt. Ich habe diesen Abend unfassbar genossen.

<p>Hi, Bassdrummer.
Also wenn du so fragst: Definitiv um beides ! ;-)
Es gibt fuer mich generell nichts schoeneres, als wenn man bei einer Frau jede Rippe sieht und der Bauch ganz flach und eingesunken ist mit einem leichten Sixpack. Und drahtige, lange, schlanke Beine mit definierten Muskeln sind ebenso toll. Und wenn so eine zarte, huebsche Elfe, dann auch noch der Kaelte trotzt weil sie sexy sein und ihre Figur zeigen oder sonst wie durch ihre Haerte alle beeindrucken will oder tapfer im eiskalten Wasser trainiert um so eine Figur zu bekommen, dann ist das zum ausflippen. Ausserdem frieren Maedels mit einem geringen Koerperfettanteil leichter und wenn jeder Muskel unter der zarten, duennen Gaensehaut zittert, dann find ich das extrem sexy.
Carina war mit mir bei einem Geschaeftsevent. Sie hatte ein schwarzes Kleid mit Minirocklaenge, aermellos und rueckenfrei an. Selbst bei 30 Grad waere sie mit ihrer Figur damit der blanke Wahnsinn gewesen. Ihre schlanken, drahtigen und leicht muskuloesen Beine, der kleine, feste Hintern, ihr flacher Bauch mit der schmalen Taille, ... die war echt atemberaubend. Waehrend des Events hat sie allenfalls ein wenig gefroestelt, trotzdem haben einige Maenner (sehr zum Aerger ihrer Begleitungen) ihre Figur angehimmelt und sie mitfuehlend gefragt, ob ihr nicht kalt waere. Aber als wir am Heimweg waren und noch etwas rumgeknutscht haben und sie im kalten Wind zu frieren begonnen hat, war das schon wieder was, was mein Blut zum Kochen gebracht hat. Die Gaensehaut auf ihren zarten Schultern und die Schulterblaetter zu spueren, ihre zitternden, schlanken Oberschenkel ... das war schon was. Also: definitiv beides :-)</p>

<p>Hi Martin.
Hatte beim Posten auch Fehlermeldungen.
Ja, Carina ist definitiv an ihre Grenzen gegangen. Was das Hungern betrifft sowieso, obwohl ich schon zugeben muss, dass ihre Figur im Moment extrem schoen ist. Duenner werden sollte sie jetzt nicht mehr, da sie mit 42-43 kg bei ihrer Grösse sonst zu knochig wird. Jetzt hat sie kein Fett aber noch genug Muskeln, um durchtrainiert aber nicht ausgemergelt zu wirken. Man sieht ihr zwar an, dass sie hungert, aber sie wirkt trotzdem topfit. Und das ist sie auch. Sie wird auch nicht öfter krank, als andere. Obwohl sie nach ihrem Bad vor der norwegischen Kueste und vor allem der Heimfahrt im Bikini total ausgekuehlt war und trotz aller Leidenschaftlichkeiten stundenlang weiter gezittert hat, ist sie nicht krank geworden.  Ich denke schon, dass das Rauchen Lisa nicht gut tut. Außerdem ist sie noch extremer wie meine Freundin. Nachdem die zwei Damen eine aehnliche Figur haben duerften, hat Lisa keine Isolierschicht und friert jetzt im Oktober sicher extrem wenn sie noch im Bikini im See schwimmt. Carina hat zwar neulich gemeint, dass sie sich abhaerten und noch im Freien als Training schwimmen will (natuerlich verbunden mit der Zusage, dass ich sie so wie in Norwegen aufwaerme ;-)), aber getraut hat sie sich noch nicht. Ich wuerde sie auch wahrscheinlich nicht wieder zurück ins eiskalte Wasser schicken, wenn sie eh schon vor Kaelte bibbert. Umgekehrt finde ich die Haerte deiner Lisa schon faszinierend. Meine schoene Eisprinzessin nimmt das Frieren eher in Kauf um mich zu verfuehren, geniessen tut sie dann aber primaer das Aufwaermen. Lisa gehts offenbar primaer darum zu beweisen, wie hart und tapfer sie ist und dass sie fuer deinen Sohn alles macht, egal wie sehr sie dabei koerperlich leidet. Ich verstehe trotzdem, dass dir das auch sehr gefaellt und nach 2x schwimmen nass und nur im Bikini es bei 8 Grad aushalten zu muessen war natuerlich hart fuer sie und diese zarte, bibbernde Elfe mit ihrer Gaensehaut und dem ausgehungerten, durchtrainierten, zitternden Koerper im Arm zu halten war sicher faszinierend fuer dich und Lisa hat deine Waerme auch gut getan. Dein Sohn laesst sie offenbar gerne leiden und sie geniesst es, dass sie Ihm beweisen kann wie bedingungslos sie ihn liebt und wie mutig und tapfer und beinhart sie ist und du waermst und beschuetzt sie und erloest sie ein bisschen von ihren Qualen und erlaubst ihr, sich ein bisschen hilflos und schutzsuchend an dich zu kuscheln, was sie (und du) auch geniesst. So habt ihr alle was davon. ;-)</p>

<p>Ah ok, das ist bei mir ein klein wenig anders. Ja, schlank gefällt mir ganz sicher besser, aber es muss nicht so dünn sein. Interessiert euch dabei nur die eigene Frau, oder auch das Zittern bei anderen Frauen? Ich weiß das man das private immer privat lassen muss, aber habt ihr vielleicht grundsätzlich Videos von zitternden Frauen? Nicht eure eigenen. :-)</p>

<p>Ich habe zu meiner Lehrzeit in jeder Pause auf dem Schulhof eine junge Dame beobachten können, sie war damals vielleicht 18 Jahre alt. Sie hatte immer eine Stoffhose oder Leggings an und sie hat jede Pause gefroren. Insebondere ihre Beine und ihr Arsch zitterten ganz offensichtlich. Ein super heißes Bild. :-)</p>

<p>Hi IcemanX,
Deine Carina muss eine wahnsinnig perfekte Figur haben, 42 kg und dazu noch definierte Muskeln ist eine Traumfigur. Gut dass Carina so topfit ist und nicht mal eine Erkältung bekommen hat. Auch bei Lisa hat sich ihr regelmäßiges Schwimmtraining bezahlt gemacht, kein Gramm Fett und ein leichter Muskelansatz lässt ihren braungebrannten Körper perfekt aussehen. Leider ist Lisa jetzt ständig erkältet, das scheint sie aber nicht zu stören, jedenfalls ist sie immer gut gelaunt und sie trainiert fleißig weiter und ist immer noch wie im Hochsommer angezogen, heute sogar barfuß. Wahrscheinlich schwächt das viele Rauchen ihre Immunabwehr, sie raucht wirklich extrem viel, es müssen mehrere Schachteln am Tag sein, wir waren heute gemeinsam unterwegs und während ich mein Mittagessen bestellt und gegessen habe hat sie zwei Pötte schwarzen Kaffee getrunken  und 8 Zigaretten, habe mal mitgezählt, geraucht. Ich habe sie auf ihren Husten und das Rauchen angesprochen, sie meinte nur: Mach dir nicht so viele Gedanken, der Husten wird schon wieder vergehen und solange ich rauche, brauche ich nichts zu essen,  ich muss doch auf meine Figur achten. Ich konnte nicht anders, legte meine Hand auf ihren mit Gänsehaut bedecktem Oberschenkel und sagte: Du hast eine Traumfigur. Sie gab mir einen Wangenkuss und meinte: Danke, aber fühlst du es nicht, ein bisschen Speck muss noch runter. Ich: Aber Lisa, ich fühle nur Muskeln. Sie lächelte mich an: Du bist so lieb zu mir, aber dein Sohn ist da anderer Meinung.
Vielleicht ist Lisa auch deshalb ständig erkältet, weil sie nicht nur im kalten Wasser trainiert, sondern schon total ausgekühlt am See ankommt und auch danach keine Möglichkeit bekommt sich aufzuwärmen. Sie ist wirklich hart zu sich selbst und möchte es allen beweisen, dass sie einfach keine warmen Klamotten braucht. Du hast wahrscheinlich recht, dass wir alle etwas von Lisas Leidenschaft haben. Sie kann sich und allen anderen beweisen, das ihr kein Opfer zu groß für ihre Liebe ist, mein Sohn geniesst die Hingabe seiner Freundin und pusht sie immer weiter und ich genieße es meinen Beschützerinstinkt auszuleben. Wenn nur nicht meine Sorge um Lisa wäre. Du hättest sie auf der Gartenschaukel erleben müssen, ihr muss unvorstellbar kalt gewesen sein, ihre Gänsehaut war eiskalt, jeder einzelne Muskel zitterte, ihr Husten und ihre klappernden Zähne liessen mich zwischen Faszination und Sorge schwanken. Auf dem Nachhauseweg durfte ich Lisa im Arm halten, weil mein Sohn noch weg musste, sie konnte kaum laufen, weil sie am ganzen Körper zitterte, ich wollte ihr meine Jacke überhängen, aber sie wehrte sich: Ich möchte den kühlen Wind auf meiner Haut spüren. Kurzzeitig zitterte und hustete sie so stark, dass sie die Kontrolle über ihren Körper verlor und ich ihr nun wieder meine Jacke anbot, sie meinte darauf nur: Kein Problem. Ich habe nicht mal im Winter eine Jacke gebraucht, ich muss mich nur erst an das kühlere Wetter gewöhnen. Ich nahm sie noch fester in den Arm und spürte ihre eiskalte Gänsehaut, das Zittern und bewunderte Lisa ihr Durchhaltevermögen.

<p>Hallo Martin, hallo IcemanX, 
vielen Dank fuer Eure diversen und spannenden Beitraege.
Ihr habt - passend zum Thema - schon haeufig erwaehnt, dass Carina / Lisa immer recht knapp bekleidet sind. Natuerlich ist ein Minirock oder ein bauchfreies Oberteil in dieser Jahreszeit schon an sich ein Hingucker. Wie wuerdet ihr den Kleidungsstil denn bei sommerlichen Temperaturen beschreiben? Durchschnittlich, jugendlich, sexy, gewagt oder eher extrem knapp (ein wenig freier Bauch zu sehen oder "underboobs", blickdicht oder eher transparent, Mini oder Micromini, Bikini eher Tanga oder String, ...)? Was tragen sie untendrunter?</p>

<p>Fuehlen sich Carina / Lisa - abgesehen von der Kaelte - in ihrer Kleidung wohl oder kostet es sie Ueberwindung, sich so zu "praesentieren"?</p>

<p>An IcemanX: Wie verliefen die weiteren Tage in Eurem Urlaub?</p>

<p>Ferfred</p>

<p>Hallo ferfred,
Ich habe schon viel über ihren Kleidungsstil geschrieben, vielleicht sogar zu viel, wenn ich Lisa nicht kennengelernt hätte, würde ich nicht glauben, dass es Frauen auch im Winter über Stunden nur in knappen Sommklamotten aushalten, um zu zeigen wie hart und sexy sie sind.
Lisa trägt im Sommer erst recht knappen Klamotten, sie zeigt eigentlich immer sehr viel von ihrer braungebrannten Haut. Ihre Oberteile sind immer sehr sexy, aber unterschiedlicher Art, oft trägt sie Bandeautops, die sehr schmal ausfallen, aber auch Spaghettiträger-Tops, die dann aber auch über dem Bauchnabel enden und manchmal leicht transparent wirken, finde ich sehr schön aber auch gewagt, da sie eigentlich nie einen BH trägt, was dann jeder sehen kann. Das sie wirklich sehr schlank ist und dadurch keine riesige Oberweite hat, braucht sie den auch nicht. Ich finde sie auch sehr sexy, wenn sie nur ein Bikinioberteil als einzige Oberbekleidung tägt. Dazu fast immer verschiedene Miniröcke, die im stehen gerade ihren Po bedecken. Darunter winzige Strings, die bei solch kurzen Miniröcke immer wieder mal hervorblitzen. Ich glaube, dass sie sich mittlerweile sehr wohl fühlt, sich so zu präsentieren. Auch wenn sie die einzige ist, die so sexy und gewagte Klamotten trägt. In letzter Zeit war sie sehr oft barfuß unterwegs, aber auch in Hohen Schuhen. Ich glaube sie geniesst auch die zufälligen oder vielleicht auch nicht so zufälligen und bewundernden Berührungen der Anderen.

<p>Hi, bassdrummer.</p>

<p>Es hat mich schon immer fasziniert, wenn ein Maedel trotz Kaelte viel Haut zeigt und dementsprechend eine Gaensehaut hat und zittert. Vor allem wenn sie das tapfer durchhaelt und nicht deswegen rumjammert.</p>

<p>Seit ich mit meiner Freundin zusammen bin und daher live das volle Programm geniessen darf und sie schon extrem gut aussieht und ich generell sehr happy mit ihr bin, sind andere Frauen natuerlich nicht mehr SO interessant. Umgekehrt waere es gelogen, wenn ich behaupten wuerde, dass mich andere (frierende) huebsche Maedels jetzt gar nicht mehr interessieren wuerden. Also, offiziell ist natuerlich nur sie interessant und sonst niemand und ... na, ja ... ;-)</p>

<p>Videos kenn i nur aus dem www. Da san die Links aber eh meistens bekannt.</p>

<p>Hi, ferfred2.</p>

<p>Also Carinas Outfits wechseln sehr. Da sie viel mit dem Rad unterwegs ist und viel Sport macht wuerde ich ihren Kleidungsstil als laessig-sportlich bezeichnen. Umgekehrt ist Oeko, Fairtrade etc. voll ihr Thema (sie ist die klassische Weltverbesserin), sodass sie jetzt nicht mit den typischen Sportklamotten rumrennt. Es macht auch einen Unterschied ob sie mit mir unterwegs ist oder nicht. Auch wenn man das nach dem Lesen meiner Posts kaum glaubt, so ist sie eine kleine Frostbeule und den sexy Chillylook hat sie eigentlich nur, um mich oder generell ihre Umgebung zu beeindrucken. 
Sie kann auch extrem stylish und elegant sein ...</p>

<p>Also biologisch-sportlich oder manchmal dress to impress.</p>

<p>Wenn sie sich aber sexy styled und viel Haut zeigt, dann tut sie das schon sehr gerne (abgesehen von der Kaelte, unter der leidet sie definitiv, auch wenn sie das nicht zugibt). Sie ist zwar nicht so eine typische Beautyqueen, die sich nur mit ihrem Look beschaeftigt und ueber andere die Nase ruempft, aber sie arbeitet hart fuer ihr Aussehen und ist auch stolz darauf und freut sich, wenn ich (und andere) sie huebsch finden. </p>

<p>Urlaub war ansonsten unspektakulaer (zumindest was das Thema hier anbelangt).</p>

<p>Hi, Martin99.</p>

<p>Also Lisas Figur ist sicher genauso der Hammer. Versteh natuerlich deine Bedenken, andererseits ist sie eben nur deshalb so toll, weil sie nichts isst und so hart trainiert. Hab bei Carina wenn sie tagelang fastet obwohl sie so duenn ist, auch immer ein schlechtes Gewissen, andererseits haette sie diese tolle Figur nicht, wenn sie sich dafuer nicht quaelen wuerde. Lisas Haerte und Durchhaltevermoegen ist allerdings schon extrem. Carina hat zwar auch grossmaeulig angekuendigt, dass sie noch im freien schwimmen will, um sich abzuhaerten, aber gemacht hat sie es noch nicht. Und ich werde sie da auch nicht pushen, weil es hier in der Schweiz natuerlich jetzt schon extrem kalt ist. Klar,  Deutschland ist auch nicht waermer, ... Darum ist es schon krass, dass deine Lisa noch in einem See schwimmt. Im Bikini ! Mit Neopren lass ich mir das ja einreden, obwohl ihr da genauso nach einer Weile kalt waere, wenn das nicht so ein extraisolierender Thermaanzug ist. Und dass sie sich nachher nicht aufwaermen darf, ist fuer das arme Maedchen sicher die pure Folter. Andererseits scheint sie das zu geniessen, weil sie sich dann total stark und mutig fuehlt, deinem Sohn beweist, dass sie ihn bedienungslos liebt und dass du sie waermst und sie nicht mehr so extrem leiden laesst, taugt ihr auch. Du und dein Sohn ergaenzt euch da bei ihr ... er laesst sie leiden und du bist fuersorglich. Waermt ER sie eigentlich nie ? Bewundert er sie dafuer ? Was waere, wenn du nichts taetest ? Wuerde er sie weiter frieren lassen oder sie abtrocknen und aufwaermen ?
Ihr muss auf der Gartenschaukel sicher eiskalt gewesen sein. Wenn sie bei 8 Grad, fast nackt und klatschnass dasitzen muss, nachdem sie zuvor bibbernd im eiskalten Wasser geschwommen ist und das wahrscheinlich hungrig, dann ist das zwar ehrlicherweise eine sehr erotische Vorstellung, im realen Leben fuer Lisa aber koerperlich eine unbeschreibliche Qual, (die sie halt trotzdem genossen hat). Hat er darauf irgendwie reagiert ?</p>

<p>Hi, zusammen.
Neben schlanken Maedels mit Gaensehaut habe ich noch eine zweite Leidenschaft: alte Motorraeder. Leider sind in meinem Fall diese beiden Dinge nur schwer in Einklang zu brennen, da meine Freundin ein ziemlicher Oeko-Freak ist und zudem jedesmal mein verfruehtes Ende durch einen Unfall kommen sieht. Dass sie selbst bei jedem Wetter mit ihrem uralten, rostigen, klapprigen Fahrrad faehrt, laesst sie natuerlich nicht gelten. Habe nun eine alte Bonneville restauriert oder besser gesagt restaurieren lassen (weil keine Zeit und 2 linke Haende) und wollte vor dem Winter unbedingt eine Tour machen. Es hat mich viel Verhandlungsgeschick gekostet, meine huebsche Eisprinzessin zum Mitfahren zu ueberreden. Als ich sie von zuhause abgeholt habe, habe ich also erwartet, dass sie mit 2 Motorradkluften uebereinander erscheinen wuerde und war umso begeisterter, dass sie trotz 8 Grad so sexy gestyled war, wie ich das gerne habe: Barfuss in Converse, nackte Beine, Hotpants, eine kurze Jeansjacke, die sie jedoch offen gelassen hatte und darunter ein aermelloses und fast rueckenfreies T-Shirt oder Tanktop oder was immer dieses bikinioberteilartige Ding war, dass zu meiner Freude gerade bis zum Unterrand ihrer Brueste reichte und zusammen mit den tief geschnittenen Hotpants viel von ihrem eingesunkenen Waschbrettbauch frei gelassen hat. Selbst im Hochsommer waere bei ihrer Figur dieses Outfit ein Hingucker gewesen, aber jetzt im November ... wau ! - Wird dir nicht zu kalt ? - Sie gluehte mich mit ihren grossen, dunklen Augen an und meinte nur schnippisch: - Wenn es dir nicht gefaellt, dann kann ich ja noch einen Pullover und lange Hosen anziehen. Ausserdem hoffe ich ja, dass du Mitleid mit mir hast und nicht zu weit faehrst ... - Ich grinste sie an. - Okay, wohl doch nicht ... Dann kann ich ja nur hoffen, dass du mich wieder waermst nachher. - - Schauen wir mal ... - Ich nahm sie kurz in den Arm, fuhr unter ihre Jacke und streichelte ihr sanft über den Ruecken. Selbst die kurze Zeit unseres Gespraeches hatte sie bereits etwas froesteln lassen. Als sie sich hinter mich auf das Motorrad geschwungen hat, streichelte ich ganz zart ueber ihre schlanken, muskuloesen Oberschenkel die jetzt schon mit einer Gaensehaut bedeckt waren. Ich liebe ihre weiche, leicht gebraeunte Haut und ihre definierten Muskeln machen mich immer ganz nervoes. Sie liess die Jacke offen und schmiegte sich eng an mich. Ihre Haende waren jetzt schon eiskalt. Wir starteten los. Leider war das Bike so laut und die Vibrationen so stark, dass ich nicht mal bemerkt haette, wenn sie heruntergefallen waere. Ich machte daher nach 20 Minuten an einem Aussichtspunkt ueber der Stadt halt, um das Zusammensein mit einer Liebsten auch geniessen zu koennen. Wie erwartet, war meine Schoene mittlerweile duchgefroren. Ihre Beine und ihrer flacher Bauch waren blau vor Kaelte, ihre schoenen weissen Zaehne klapperten und sie zitterte am ganzen Koerper. Ich setzte mich auf die Holzbank die dort stand und fragte scheinheilig: - Na, ist dir nicht doch zu kalt ? - Carina setzte sich auf meinen Schoss und begann mich leidenschaftlich zu kuessen: - Ich hasse deine Motorraeder, aber ich liebe dich ... - Der eiskalte Wind der ueber die Anhoehe pfiff liess sie noch mehr frieren. Trotzdem streifte ich die Jacke von den Schultern. Ihre zitternden Muskeln und ihre Gaensehaut sind einfach aufregend. Zu gerne haette ich die Situation ausgekostet, aber just als ich an den Baendern ihres Oberteils herumfummelte begann es zu regnen. - Fahren wir, sonst landen wir bei den engen Kurven noch im Hospital - Carina sprang wie von der Tarantel gestochen von mir herunter. Ich war echt sauer ueber das abrupte Ende unseres potentiell leidenschaftlichen Stops. Andererseits war der Anblick der sich mir jetzt bot durchaus geeignet, die Spannung aufrecht zu halten. Ohne Jacke und jetzt wo ich sie nicht mehr Arm hielt und der kalte Regen auf sie nieder prasselte ... sie bibberte vor Kaelte und ihre nasse Gaensehaut erinnerte mich beinahe an ihr Bad in Norwegen. Die Fahrt zu meinem Haus dauerte fast eine Stunde. Sie war klatsch nass und zitterte am ganzen Koerper. - Ich hasse deine Motorraeder ! - Ihre Zaehne klapperten so sehr, dass sie kaum sprechen konnte. Da die Heizung abgeschaltet und es in meinem Wohnzimmer recht kuehl war und weil offenes Feuer doch sehr romantisch ist, zuendete ich den Kamin an und zog mich rasch um. Carina hatte sich zwischenzeitlich ihrer nassen Klamotten entledigt, wie immer eines meiner Hemden geklaut und kauerte bibbernd mit einer Decke in der Ecke meiner grossen Coach. Natuerlich haben wir dort weiter gemacht, wo uns der Regen gestoert hat. </p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
noch mal eine Nachfrage zu Deinem Bericht vom 9.10. von der Party. Du schreibst, dass Lisa "natuerlich" nichts gegessen hat. Weisst du, bzw. hast du mitbekommen, ob sie nur auf der Party nichts gegessen hat, weil dass Essen wahrscheinlich nicht besonders gesund und kalorienarm war, oder ob sie auch schon vor diesem und aehnlichen Anlaessen schon moeglichst lange vorher nichts isst, damit ihr Bauch moeglichst eingefallen aussieht? Was hatte sie auf der Party an? Hat sie sich eher draussen oder drinnen aufgehalten? Was hat denn die Gastgeberin im besonderen aufgeregt: Dass sie so duenn ist, dass sie nichts isst, dass sie bereit ist zu frieren fuer ihren Freund oder dass sie zuviel von ihrem Koerper zeigt? Wie geht dein Sohn denn waehrend einer solchen Party mit ihr um? Streichelt er sie, heizt er sie an, wie scharf er sie findet - oder tut er so, als ob das alles selbstverstaendlich sei?

<p>Hallo Martin, nochmal zum Besuch im Garten des Freundes deines Sohnes: Hat Lisa versucht, auf der Schaukel noch ganz locker zu sitzen, Arme an der Seite, Beine locker baumelnd etc. oder eher zusammengekauert? Wie knapp war der Bikin? Wie lange ward ihr noch draussen?

<p>Hi IcemanX, hi ferfred,
hat sich Carina überwunden und war nochmal im Freien schwimmen? Ich glaube es ist gut, wenn du sie nicht pushst und sie es jetzt nicht mehr schwimmen geht.Deine Carina zeigt schon genug Härte mit dir im November auf deiner Maschine mitzufahren. Ihr muss unglaublich kalt gewesen sein, schon im Sommer wäre es eine Herausforderung  so leicht bekleidet auf ein Motarrad zu steigen, aber sie weiss, wie sehr du es liebst ihren schlanken Körper eiskalt zu erleben und sie würde alles tun, um dich zu verführen. Beneidenswert so eine Freundin zu haben, die ihre Jacke für dich ablegt, obwohl ihre Gänsehaut schon blau und eiskalt ist. Es muss megahart für sie gewesen sein im, als ihr eiskalter Körper dann durch den Regen noch weiter auskühlte und sie vor lauter Zittern kaum auf der Maschine halten konnte. Sicher hast du sie im Anschluß voller Leidenschaft aufgewärmt. Auch wenn sie dein Motorrad hasst, so liebt sie sich um so mehr. Hat sie den Ausflug ohne Erkältung verkraftet? Lisa ist immer noch schlimm erkältet, doch sie gibt es nicht wirklich zu. Ich mache mir manchmal echt Sorgen. Sie trainiert weiter im See, sicher ist es in Deutschland noch wärmer, doch im Bikini schon recht kühl. Aber sie kommt schon total ausgekühlt am See an und auch nach dem training hat sie oft keine Möglichkeit sich aufzuwärmen. Ich habe sie heute versucht zu überzeugen, erst mal ihre Erkältung auszukurieren, sie kam barfuß, im Minirock und einem winzigen dünnen rückenfreien Oberteil von ihrem Schwimmtraining zu mir. Doch Lisa meinte hustend und zähneklappernd: "Ich kann doch mein Training nicht einfach abbrechen, der Husten wird schon wieder vergehen." Ich hielt ihren zitterneden Körper im Arm und genoss es ihre eiskalte Gänsehaut zu berühren: "Lisa, zieh dir doch wenigstens eine Jacke über." Lisa küsste meine Wange und lächelte: "Du kennst doch deinen Sohn, eine Jacke würde er bestimmt nicht toll finden" Ich habe mich wieder mal dabei ertappt, dass ich mir zwar große Sorgen um sie mache, aber Lisa unglaublich sexy finde, wenn sie in ihren Sommeroutfit daherkommt. Aber es ist sicher auch eine Portion Sadismus dabei, wenn er sie leiden lässt. Nein, er wärmt sie nie, wenn sie unterwegs sind, für ihn ist es selbstverständlich, dass Lisa fast nackt und manchmal noch klatschnass unglaublich friert. Er provoziert dann eher noch Situationen um zu zeigen, dass Lisa alles für ihn tun würde. Aber er reagiert natürlich auf sie, er streichelt dann zum Beispiel ihre bläuliche Gänsehaut, wenn die anderen Mädels in ihren warmen Klamotten frieren und ins Warme wollen, macht ihr ein Kompliment und pusht sie dann gleich wieder:"Schön deine Haut zu fühlen, kommst du noch mit,um um die Häuser zu ziehen oder ist es dir auch zu kalt?" Ganz gleich, wie durchgefroren sie auch ist: "Mit dir gehe ich überall hin." Ich denke schon, dass er sie dafür bewundert und sie zu Hause auch gebührend dafür belohnt. Lisa hat mir in einer schwachen Minute gestanden, dass es für sie die größte Erfüllung ist, wenn ihr eiskalter zitternder Körper durch Sex wieder aufgewärmt wird.
Noch kurz zu den restlichen Fragen:Lisa isst insgesamt sehr wenig, auf der Party hat sie nichts gegessen, zu solchen Anlässen isst sie fast nie, Lisa lehnt dann immer Angebotenes ab: "Ich bin auf Diät und kann nicht schon wieder was essen"mein Sohn pusht sie auch hier, indem er betont, dass sie an ihre Figur denken soll, zu vorher kann ich nichts sagen, aber ihr Bauch ist eigentlich fast immer "eingefallen",kein Fett, nur ein paar Muskeln. Sie war wie immer sehr sexy angezogen, ich glaube ein Minirock und ein knappes Bandeautop. Lisa hat sich die ganze Zeit draussen aufgehalten, schon um zu rauchen, natürlich waren die männlichen Gäste immer in ihrer Nähe. Ich glaube die Gastgeberin hat alles aufgeregt, dass sie so duenn ist, dass sie nichts isst, dass sie bereit ist zu frieren fuer ihren Freund und dass sie zuviel von ihrem Koerper zeigt.Sie war einfach eifersüchtig, da sie nicht mehr im Mittelpunkt stand.
Ansonsten versucht Lisa immer locker zu bleiben, egal wie kalt ihr ist, ich habe sie noch nie zusammengekauert gesehen. Insgesamt war Lisa mehrere Stunden in ihrem knappen Bikini draussen.

<p>Hi, Martin. Nein, sie hat mir zwar nochmals ein YT-Video gezeigt (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eEDmZlVCCzc) und mir vorgeschwaermt wie toll sie es finden wuerde, das auch auszuprobieren, aber dabei ist es geblieben. Hab sie umgekehrt aber nicht angestachelt weil es jetzt jetzt fast immer unter 10 Grad hat und die Gewaesser dementsprechend kalt sind. Find sie zwar super suess und super sexy wenn sie vor Kaelte schnattert, andererseits leidet sie dadurch schon sehr. Krank wird sie nie, aber sie ist trotz ihrer luftigen Klamotten und obwohl sie manchmal wirklich extreme Dinge tut (wie im Urlaub) nicht wirklich abgehaertet. Also deine Lisa ist da schon noch extremer, obwohl es offenbar fuer sie genauso um Verfuehrung geht und sie Sex genauso als 'Belohnung' sieht. Carina hat - wenn sie so duenne Klamotten an hat - eigentlich immer eine Gaensehaut und sie zittert jetzt um die Zeit auch dauernd. Nachdem Sie durch Training und ihre strenge Diaet ihren Koerperfettanteil wirklich extrem minimiert hat, friert sie natuerlich noch mehr. Sie geniesst die Bewunderung der Umstehenden und vor allem von mir zwar sehr, das was sie aber wirklich richtig toll findet ist, wenn ich sie dann aufwaerme und das am besten mit Sex. Die Kaelte selber ist fuer sie nur Mittel zum Zweck. Wenn ich nicht dabei bin, ist sie darum auch angezogen wie eine Polarforscherin. Frierend viel Haut zu zeigen, ist nur eine Verfuehrungstaktik von ihr ... und zwar eine sehr effiziente. ;-)
Die Motorradtour war sicher sehr hart fuer sie, den Abschluss haben wir aber beide sehr genossen. Und das war ja das eigentliche Ziel der Aktion. Klar schwingt bei uns auch immer eine gehoerige Portion SM mit und das sie bereit ist, zu frieren, um mich zu verfuehren, finde ich schon extrem geil und das sie so hart trainiert und oft hungrig bleibt um fuer mich huebsch zu sein ist auch toll. Aber mir ist genauso wichtig, dass sie trotzdem happy ist und vor allem keinen Schaden nimmt. Bei Lisa ist es offenbar deine Funktion, auf sie aufzupassen und es ist gut, dass du das machst. Gerade wenn Maedels (gilt aber fuer Maenner auch) bereit sind, alles zu tun, kann es auch gefaehrlich werden. Vielleicht hoert sie ja mit dem vielen Rauchen auf, wenn sie realisiert, dass das fuer ihre Sportlichkeit kontraproduktiv ist und vielleicht kannst du sie ja ueberzeugen, dass sie trotz aller Haerte nicht uebertreibt und irgendwann ernsthaft unterkuehlt ist. Die meisten Frauen, die Winterschwimmen betreiben, tun dies nur wenige Minuten und ich habe auch noch nie ein Maedchen erlebt, dass es so lange im eiskalten Wasser aushaelt und so duenn wie Lisa oder Carina ist. Ein schlanker, durchtrainierter Body ohne Fett ist sexy (find ich) aber kuehlt natuerlich schnell.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin, hallo Icemann,
gibt es schon wieder Neuigkeiten von Euren Eisprinzessinnen? So langsam wird das Wetter spannend und Weihnachtsmaerkte bilden ein ideales Umfeld um die Standhaftigkeit der Damen oeffentlich unter Beweis zu stellen.
Habt ihr schon etwas geplant?</p>

<p>Hallo, Ferfred2.
Ja, die Vorweihnachtszeit ist zwar sehr stressig (darum auch meine Posting-Pause), bietet aber reichlich Gelegenheiten für sexy Adventures.
Habe schon von Sophia, der Liebsten meines Freundes erzaehlt. Wir haben uns zu viert, am spaeten Abend im Stadtzentrum getroffen, um durch die Weihnachtsmaerkte zu bummeln. Ich haette Sophia beinahe nicht wiedererkannt. Nicht nur, dass sie mittlerweile kurze Haare hatte, muss sie - obwohl sie immer schon sehr schlank und durchtrainiert war - mindestens 10 kg abgenommen haben, da sie zwar muskuloeser, ansonsten aber fast genauso duenn wie meine Carina war und mit ihrer engen, schwarzen Cargohose und dem bauchfreien Tanktop aussah wie eine Elitekaempferin aus einem James Bond-Film. Ihr flacher Sixpack war schon sehr beeindruckend.  Klar, war mein Freund maechtig stolz auf sie und seine Erklaerung, dass sie ihre Jacke vergessen haette, entlockte mir nur ein leichtes Grinsen. - Ja, Carina auch. Scheint, dass die Maedels beide sehr vergesslich sind ... - Offenbar hatten die beiden im Vorfeld beschlossen, uns trotz leichten Schneefall und fast 0 Grad ordentlich einzuheizen, denn meine Eisprinzessin war mit einem hellblauen Minirock und einem da zu passenden aermellosen und bauchfreien Oberteil erschienen. Waehrend der Fahrt mit dem Auto war ja alles okay, da mein Freund die Heizung am Anschlag hatte, aber draussen in der Kaelte dauerte es nur wenige Minuten bis unsere zwei Ladies blaue Lippen hatten und bibberten. Beide beteuerten zwar, dass ihnen nicht kalt sei, doch die Gaensehaut auf ihren Waschbrettbaeuchen bewies das Gegenteil. Carina fror aufgrund ihrer nackten Beine und weil sie doch noch zarter war als Sophia natuerlich schneller. Die Blicke vor allem der maennlichen Besucher auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt waren alle auf die beiden gerichtet. Das witzigste war, als ein Typ im Weihnachtsmannkostuem den beiden nachgepfiffen hat. Also sogar Santa Claus fand die zwei frierenden Elfen sexy. Wir haben an einem Gluehweinstand halt gemacht, wobei die Damen wegen ihrer Figur natuerlich auf den Gluehwein verzichtet haben. Nachdem das Zittern der beiden immer heftiger geworden ist, haben sie irgendwann wieder begonnen, sich gegenseitig zu  waermen. Mama mia, das war ein Anblick ! Uns Maennern sind dadurch die Schweissperlen auf der Stirn gestanden. Den Maedels hat es aber nichts genutzt, sodass wir es gut sein haben lassen und unsere Eisprinzessinnen nicht laenger gequaelt haben. </p>

<p>Hallo Iceman,
ja, das ist richtig - man hetzt von einer Besinnlichkeit zur naechsten ...</p>

<p>Ein paar Fragen seien mir dennoch gestattet zu eurem Ausflug. Tragen die beiden irgendwas unter ihrer Prinzessinnenkleidung? Haben die beiden untereinander Kontakt um sich z.B. vorher abzusprechen? Meinst Du, Carina hat extra einen kurzen (wie kurz denn genau?) Rock angehabt um sicher zu stellen, dass sie weniger traegt als Sophie? Gibt es zwischen den beiden einen "Wettkampf"?
Hast Du fuer die Weihnachtstage irgendwelche Plaene oder stachelst Du Carina irgendwie an? Oder plant ihr alles ganz normal und du laesst dich ueberraschen, was Carina daraus macht?</p>

<p>In 2013 (30.12.) schrieb ich hier schon mal von einer anderen Dame und ihren Herausforderungen fuer Weihnachten. Koenntest Du Dir Aehnliches auch vorstellen?</p>

<p>Hi, ferfred.
Also bei Sophie weiss ich es nicht, Carina hat immer einen Slip und ihre Roecke sind meist eher klassisch bis zur Mitte des Oberschenkels. Was das Verhaeltnis der beiden Maedels betrifft, so sind sie so locker befreundet. Also sie sind nicht best friends aber verstehen sich ganz gut. Vor unserem Treffen haben sie sich definitiv abgesprochen und ich glaub - auch wenn sie sich moegen und respektieren - dass da schon einiges an Konkurrenzverhalten da ist. Sophie ist groesser und von Natur aus kraeftiger gebaut, sie hat(te) eine Figur wie eine Bodybuilderin, Carina mehr wie eine Tänzerin. Nachdem ich Sophie laenger nicht gesehen habe, ist mir aber aufgefallen, dass sie extrem abgenommen hat. Offenbar versucht sie da schon, Carina nachzueifern. Umgekehrt versucht Carina immer ein bisschen mehr Muskel zu bekommen, aber weiter duenn und drahtig zu sein. Die zwei Damen haben sich auch puncto Kaelteresistenz nichts geschenkt. Carina ist zwar da noch haerter, aber nur in dem Sinn, dass sie leidensfaehiger ist und nicht jammert. Weil sie aber noch immer einen niedrigeren Koerperfettanteil hat als Sophie und kleiner und zarter ist, friert sie schneller und mehr. </p>

<p>Nachdem wir beide rund um Weihnachten viel Stress im Job und wenig Zeit fuereinander hatten, wollte Carina den Jahreswechsel alleine mit mir zuhause verbringen. Gemuetlich machen. Naja. Ich war zwar zuerst wenig begeistert von der Idee, hab ihr zuliebe aber zugestimmt, vor allem weil ein kleiner Nebensatz von ihr, naemlich dass sie schon fuer Spannung sorgen wuerde, doch mein Interesse geweckt hat. Hab jedenfalls den Kamin angefeuert, Getraenke bereit gestellt, im Garten alles fuer ein kleines Feuerwerk hergerichtet und auf sie gewartet. Nachdem sie bis spaet am Abend gearbeitet hat, dachte ich nicht, dass sie sich besonders aufputzen wuerde und war daher von ihrem Outfit mehr als angetan. Obwohl sie muede und etwas abgekaempft wirkte, hatte sie sich offenbar viel Muehe gegeben, sich moeglichst huebsch zu machen, was mir natuerlich extrem geschmeichelt hat. Ihre seidigen, gelockten, schwarzen Haare waren noch leicht feucht. Ihr schwarzes Kleid war zwar kurz und aermellos, liess aber keine Haut frei. Da es aber sehr eng geschnitten war, betonte es trotzdem ihren extrem schlanken Koerper. Speziell ihr flacher, tief eingesunkener Bauch, auf den ich so sehr abfahr war deutlich zu sehen und ihre drahtigen, langen Beine mit den schwarzen Struempfen und den Highheels waren echt ein Hingucker. Wir machten es uns auf der Coach gemuetlich und natuerlich konnte ich meine Haende nicht von ihr lassen. Das Glitzern in ihren Augen und ihr schuechternes Laecheln ist ein klares Zeichen, wie happy es sie macht, wenn ich so prompt auf sie abfahre. Ich hab ihr sanft über die Rippen und den Bauch gestreichelt, der sich wie meist bei solchen Gelegenheiten mit einem lauten Knurren gemeldet hat. Am Anfang war ihr das noch peinlich. Mittlerweile weiss sie, dass ich da auch drauf stehe. 'Hast du heute schon was gegessen ?' 'Nein und ich werde heuer auch nichts mehr essen, weil ich um Mitternacht ein Date mit einem Typen hab, der voll drauf steht, wenn ich ganz duenn bin'. Sie kuesste mich ganz zart und wie beilaeufig. Ich hoerte meinen Herzschlag bis in die Ohren haemmern. Am liebsten haette ich ihr die Klamotten vom Leib gerissen und auf den Jahreswechsel und das Feuerwerk und alles gepfiffen. Aber das war Teil des Spiels. Wir haben also was getrunken und geredet ... also primaer hat sie getrunken und geredet. Ich war viel zu beschaeftigt, meine alte Pendeluhr zu hyponotisieren, damit sie schneller lief, es endlich Mitternacht wuerde und ich einen Grund haette, diese zarte, mittlerweile leicht beschwippste Elfe aus ihrem Kleid auszupacken. Um 1/2 12 bin ich foermlich in den Garten gerannt. Carina schlenderte entgegen ihrer sonstigen eher hektischen Art betont langsam und smooth hinter mir nach. Ihr Gang erinnerte mich irgendwie an eine große, schwarze Katze. Sie stellte ihr Champagnerglas ab und lehnte sich an die Hausmauer. Auf ihren schlanken, leicht muskuloesen Armen bildete sich sofort eine Gaensehaut. Das Kleid war hauchduenn und es hatte deutlich unter 0 Grad. Ich fummelte an den Feuerwerkskoerpern herum. 'Warum willst du die armen Tiere erschrecken und die Umwelt mit Feinstaub und Schwermetalen verpesten ?' 'Ha ?' Das war typisch fuer sie. Sexy as hell aber nervt mit ihrem Hang, staendig die Welt zu verbessern. Sie stackste mit ihren langen Beinen auf mich zu legte sanft die Arme seitlich an meinen Hals. Ihre Haende waren eiskalt und ich merkte, dass sie leicht zu zittern begonnen hatte. Ich nahm sie in den Arm und versuchte, sie mit meiner offenen Winterjacke etwas zu waermen. 'Vorschlag: du verzichtet auf DEIN umweltschaedliches Feuerwerk und ich sorge auf MEINE Art fuer ein anderes Feuerwerk.' Das liess ich mir nicht zweimal sagen. Ich nahm ihre eiskalte, zarte Hand und versuchte, sie sanft Richtung Haustuer zu ziehen, doch sie blieb stehen. Ich drehte mich verdutzt um. Sie begann, ganz langsam ihre Schuhe auszuziehen. 'Hilf mir bitte mit dem Zipper !'. Ich oeffnete das Kleid und streifte es soweit ich konnte von ihren Schultern. Die eiskalte Nachtluft liess ihr einen Schauer über den Ruecken laufen. Ich kuesste zaertlich ihren Nacken und die Schulterblaetter. Sie zog sich trotz der winterlichen Temperaturen langsam weiter aus und stand schließlich splitternackt vor mir. 'Bis Mitternacht musst du es noch aushalten und ich auch.' Sie laechelte mich mit ihren strahlend weissen, klappernden Zaehnen an. Es war noch eine 1/4 Stunde bis Mitternacht und obwohl Carinas schlanker Koerper  so heftig zitterte, dass sie es nicht kontrollieren konnte, versuchte sie, moeglichst cool und sexy dazustehen. Mir standen die Schweissperlen auf der Stirn. Sie kaempfte tapfer mit dem Impuls die arme zu verschraenken. Die Gaensehaut, ihre harten, kleinen Brustwarzen und das Zittern ihrer scharf definierten Muskeln hat mir echt den Atem verschlagen. 'Gefaellts dir ?', fragte sie leise und mit diesem schuechternen Laecheln, das selbst die Eiszapfen zum Schmelzen bringt. Endlich war 2020, ich hab sie ins Haus zurück getragen und das Feuerwerk dort genossen. Das Feuerwerk ohne Schwermetalle ;-).  </p>

<p>Hallo IcemanX,
du hast den Jahreswechsel ja toll erlebt, es muss herrlich für dich zu erleben gewesen sein, wie dich Carina verführt hat. ich beneide dich um so eine tolle Freundin. Bei mir gibt es nicht so viel erfreuliches zu berichten. Mein Sohn und Lisa haben sich getrennt. Die weihnachtszeit fing eigentlich gut an. Ich durfte ein paar mal mit den beiden auf den Weihnachtsmarkt.Schon die erste Woche war Lisa immer noch total erkältet, die beiden holten mich zu Hause ab, Lisa nur im kürzesten Minirock und und einem Trägertop, welches nicht einmal ihren Bauchnabel bedeckte, dazu noch barfuß, wir hatten zwar keine Minusgrade, aber es wehte ein kalter Wind. Als ich Lisa, wie immer, zur Begrüßung umarmte, konnte ich spüren, wie eiskalt ihre fast bläuliche Gänsehaut  jetzt schon war. Ich bat sie hinein fragte die beiden: Oh Gott, Lisa ist ja völlig unterkühlt. Wollten wir nicht auf den Weihnachtsmarkt oder hat Lisa ihre Jacke noch im Auto? Lisa hustete und ihre Zähne klapperten schon wie wild: Ja,es ist heute verdammt kalt, wir sind schon lange unterwegs, aber auf den weihnachtsmarkt wollen wir jetzt mit dir gemeinsam, deshalb holen wir dich doch ab, aber wir sind nicht mit dem Auto, wir wollen doch Glühwein trinken. Ich: Du kannst so doch nicht in die Kälte. Im Haus verstärkte sich ihr Zittern noch. Sie konnte kaum stehen. Mein Sohn herrschte sie an: Was ist? Möchtest du etwa hier bleiben? Lisa erschrak und konnte hustend und zähneklappernd kaum antworten: Nein, natürlich nicht, möchte doch bei dir sein. Ich: Wärmt euch doch wenigstens erstmal auf, Lisa ist ja total unterkühlt. Mein sohn: Du weißt doch, dass wir mit Marcus verabredet sind. Lisa schmiegte sich an mich, ich legte meinen Arm um ihren zitternden Körper und meinte: Lass uns gehen, mir macht die Kälte nichts aus.
Später mehr...</p>

<p>Hi, Martin99.</p>

<p>Hoffe, Eure Troubles haben sich doch noch in Wohlgefallen aufgeloest. 
Waere sonst echt schade. Lisa ist, so wie du sie beschreibst, ein wunderschoenes Maedchen mit einem perfekten Koerper, sexy, hingebungsvoll und in deinen Sohn ueber beide Ohren verliebt. Also wenn er sich von so einer Goettin getrennt hat, dann ist ihm nicht zu helfen ...  Umgekehrt kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, dass Lisa gegangen ist, nachdem sie ja bisher auch an ihre Schmerzgrenze gegangen ist. Und darueber. </p>

<p>Carina tut auch alles fuer mich. Wobei ich, je laenger ich mit ihr zusammen bin, desto mehr merke, dass da auch bei ihr die Angst dahinter steckt, mich zu verlieren und dass diese Leidensfaehigkeit, diese absolute Hingabe und dieser Mangel an Egoismus zwar schoen ist, aber bedeutet, dass ich bei meiner Eisprinzessin auch immer die Notbremse ziehen muss. </p>

<p>Und das faellt mir nicht immer leicht: Sie hat mich letzte Woche zu einer Wanderung genoetigt. Ich hasse das. Ich bin ein Stadtmensch und das Latschen durch die Botanik macht mich fertig. Aber ja, ihr zu Liebe bin ich mitgegangen. Es hatte um die null Grad, gefrierender Nebel. Bin mit ihr über die Wiesen geschnauft und wir san dann beim See in unserer Naehe an einer geschuetzten Stelle gelandet. Nachdem sie barfuss in ihren Sportschuhen war, nur eine duenne Windjacke, eine Hueftjean und eine sehr bauchfreies Shirt anhatte und ich langsam weil unsportlich bin, war sie im kalten Wind schon sehr durchgefroren. Wir haben uns auf eine Bank am Ufer gesetzt und etwas rumgemacht. Die Gaensehaut auf ihrem flachen, leicht muskuloesen Bauch war echt irre. Habe ihre Jacke trotzdem ausgezogen und zaertlich durch ihre lockigen, dunklen Haare gestreichelt, die ueber ihre schmalen und schon etwas zitternden Schultern gefallen sind. Wie ich begonnen hab, ihre Jeans aufzuknoepfen, hat sie gemeint, dass es schade waere, dass es so eiskalt ist, weil sie - wenn es Sommer waere - nun nackt im See baden koennte. &lt;&lt; Wuerde dir das gefallen ? >> &lt;&lt; Na, klar wuerde es das und ich haette auch nichts dagegen, wenn du jetzt im Winter da reinspringst. >> Ich habe gemerkt, dass alleine die Vorstellung in das eisige Wasser zu muessen, das Klappern ihrer schoenen, weissen Zaehne verstaerkt und einen Schauer durch ihren schlanken Koerper gejagt hat. Trotzdem hat sie, ohne zu zoegern sofort begonnen sich auszuziehen. Sie war so ein traumhafter Anblick, wie sie nur mit ihrem Slip bekleidet bibbernd und fröstelnd mit klappernden Zähnen da gestanden ist. &lt;&lt; Es ist so kalt ... ! >> Ich hab mit der Hand etwas Wasser aus dem See geschoepft und die Tropfen über ihre Brueste und die zitternde Bauchmuskulatur gegossen. Ihre Gaensehaut verstaerkte sich massiv und sie hat ihren flachen Waschbrettbauch so abrupt eingezogen, als wenn sie ein  Peitschenschlag getroffen haette. &lt;&lt; Ich friere so sehr. Waerme mich kurz, bevor ich da rein springe. >> Wie ich sie im Arm gehalten habe und sie ihren zitternden Koerper an mich geschmiegt hat, ist mir bewusst geworden, wie extrem diese zarte Elfe friert und was fuer eine Qual es fuer sie wird, in das eisige Wasser zu springen und dann noch nass und bibbernd den Heimweg anzutreten.  Selbst meine Hand war noch ganz taub. Ich hab also ihre Jacke geschnappt, sie darin eingewickelt und ihr gesagt, dass sie es lassen soll. Habe gar nicht bemerkt, dass das schroffer geklungen hat, als es sollte. War von mir liebevoll gemeint. Klang aber entnervt. Ich hatte, wie sie so fast nackt und frierend vor mir gestanden ist, mehr Adrenalin im Blut, wie ein tollwütiger Hund, aber das wollte ich doch nicht antun. Sie ist selbst im Auto noch zitternd und zusammengekauert gesessen und hat gefroren. Es waere hot as hell, aber auch extrem quaelend fuer sie gewesen. Sie haette es gemacht fuer mich, ohne wenn und aber. Dass ich es nicht wollte, hat sie sogar anfangs erschreckt. Sie hat sich noch mit Traenen in den Augen entschuldigt, weil sie gezoegert hat und meinte, dass sie mich jetzt enttaeuscht haette weil ihr vorher schon so kalt war und sie nicht trotzdem gleich reingesprungen ist. Dass sie meine lieb gemeinte Reaktion gekränkt hat, hat mir leid getan. Wie ich ihr dann aber klar gemacht habe, dass ich sie nur beschuetzen wollte und das sie mir wichtig waere ... unser Gespraech war wie eine Szene aus einem schnulzigen Frauenroman ... ich hab sie noch nie so gluecklich und froehlich erlebt. Ja, mir gefaellt ihre ausgehungerte, durchtrainierte Figur und ich respektiere, dass sie sich dafuer so tapfer quaelt und ich werde es auch weiter geniessen, wenn sie friert um mich zu verfuehren, aber ich werde trotzdem auf sie aufpassen, weil sie mir wichtig ist. Phantasien sind das eine, diese auszuleben super, aber - habe es eh schon oft geschrieben - im realen Leben gibt es Grenzen. </p>

<p>Hi icemanX,
du glaubst nicht, wie ich dich um deine Carina beneide. Es ist wirklich gut, dass du sie nicht ins Wasser gelassen hast. Sie wäre sicher bereit gewesen, für dich in das eisige Wasser zu springen. Es war doch sicher für dich mehr als erregend, Carina einige Tropfen auf ihre Gänsehaut zu giessen und ihre Reaktion darauf zu erleben und noch besser sie danach aufzuwärmen.</p>

<p>Nun zurück zu Lisa. Du hast recht, meinem Sohn ist nicht zu helfen, sich von einer Göttin, wie Lisa zu trennen. Wir sind an dem besagten Tag also los auf den Weihnachtsmarkt und haben Marcus mit seiner Freundin Linda getroffen. Marcus hat Lisa sehr leidenschaftlich begrüsst und damit seine Freundin wahrscheinlich eifersüchtig gemacht. Marcus war sehr bemüht immer an Lisa ihrer Seite zu sein und liess keine Gelegenheit aus Lisa ihre Zigarretten anzuzünden, dabei hielt er ihren zitternden Körper fest in seinem Arm. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich sogar ein bisschen eifersüchtig war, da ich mich immer gern dafür geopfert habe Lisa ein bisschen Wärme zu spenden. So ähnlich liefen auch die anderen Weihnachtsmarktbesuche, Linda war sichtlich genervt, von ihrem Freund Marcus, der sich zu sehr um Lisa kümmerte und mein Sohn sorgte dafür, dass Lisa immer länger in der Kälte bleiben musste.  Ich und auch Marcus versuchten unseren Ausflug auch einmal nach drinnen zu verlagern, einmal schlugen wie vor eine Ausstellung zu besuchen oder ein Restaurant zu besuchen. Doch mein Sohn verhinderte dies jedes mal. Er fragte Lisa: Macht es dir etwas aus, wenn wir noch draussen bleiben? Auch wenn ihre Zähne noch so laut klapperten antwortete sie dann: Kein Problem, auf mich müsst ihr wirklich keine Rücksicht nehmen. Einmal sassen wir nach Stunden im eisigen Wind auf einer Bank, Lisa war an ihre Grenzen gekommen, sie konnte sich nicht mehr auf den Beinen halten, immer noch total erkältet und hatte nun mittlerweile noch eine Blasenentzündung dazu bekommen (hat sie mir gebeichtet, weil sie mit mir mal allein unterwegs war und ich natürlich mitbekommen habe, dass sie ständig auf der Toilette war und jede Menge Medikamente einnahm), hustete und zitterte in Anfällen in ihrem Minirock, dabei Marcus streichelte Lisa intensiv ihren eiskalten bläulichen Oberschenkel und nackten Rücken und meinte: Wie hälst du es nur so nackt in dieser Kälte aus, bitte lass uns endlich ins Warme gehen, ziehe doch das nächste Mal wenigstens eine Jacke und eine Strumpfhose an. Lisa gestand plötzlich: Für die Liebe ist mir kein Opfer zu groß, aber ich weiss nicht, wie lange ich das noch aushalten kann.
Jetzt kommt der unerfreuliche Teil, den ich eigentlich nicht posten möchte.

<p>Hi Martin und Iceman,</p>

<p>ich hab mich lange nicht gemeldet, aber eure Berichte doch mit großer Spannung verfolgt. Umso mehr brenne ich darauf, zu wissen, wie die Geschichte mit Lisa und deinem Sohn ausging, Martin. Ich würde mich freuen, das noch erfahren zu dürfen. Und hast du jetzt noch Kontakt zu Lisa? Hat sie ihren Kleidungsstil nach der Trennung beibehalten? Und hat sie ihre Figur gehalten oder wieder etwas zugenommen? Vielleicht sogar noch ein bisschen gehungert und noch mehr abgenommen, um deinem Sohn zu zeigen, was er verpasst?</p>

<p>Iceman, wie geht es dir und deiner Carina? Habt ihr noch was Spannendes erlebt diesen Winter?</p>

<p>Würde mich auch freuen, von Lissy zu hören, falls es dich/sie noch gibt.</p>

<p>Hi,
gelegentlich habe ich noch Kontakt mit Lisa. Nach der Trennung hat sie zunächst ihren Kleidungsstil beibehalten. So waren wir sogar noch Silvester gemeinsam unterwegs, Lisa war sexy wie immer und nur in einem Minirock und einem glitzernden Bandeautop erschienen und hatte, so kam es mir vor, auch noch weiter abgenommen. Sie tat alles, um meinem Sohn zu gefallen und wäre wahrscheinlich lieber erfroren, als sich wenigstens etwas überzuziehen, sie fragte ihn sogar, ob er sie trainieren würde, sie möchte etwas für ihre Figur tun und dafür im See schwimmen gehen, doch irgendwie sind die zwei nicht wieder zusammen gekommen. Dafür ist sie jetzt mit Marcus zusammen. Er war sehr besorgt um Lisa und achtete darauf, dass Lisa sich auch mal aufwärmen konnte. Sie trug zwar immer ihre kurzen Miniröcke mit nackten Beinen, aber auch manchmal eine Jeansjacke, die zwar bauchfrei und nie geschlossen war und somit immer noch jede Menge nackte Gänsehaut frei liess. Ich glaube sie hatte sich auch von ihrer ständigen Erkältung erholt und etwas zugenommen, sie war aber immer noch sehr sehr schlank. Doch am Wochenende habe ich die beiden am See getroffen. Obwohl es wirklich kalt war, vielleicht 3 - 4 Grad, kam mir Lisa im Bikini und nassen Haaren entgegen, sie war wieder stark erkältet ,zitterte am ganzen Körper und ich konnte sehen, dass sie total abgenommen hat. Ich meinte zu ihr: Wie geht's dir, du hast ja abgenommen und bist ja total krank, ziehe dir schnell etwas über . Sie brachte kaum etwas über ihre blauen Lippen, ihre Zähne klapperten und ihr Husten liess nicht nach. Marcus, in seiner dicken Jacke und Stiefeln, hielt sie im Arm und streichelte ihre bläuliche Gänsehaut: Ja, Lisa schwimmt wieder jeden Tag ihre Runde im See, das hat ihrer Figur gut getan. Sie zieht ihr Training wirklich konsequent durch, egal wie das Wetter auch ist. Er strich ihr die nassen Haare aus dem Gesicht und küsste Lisa: Ich bewundere dich. Wollen wir noch mit Martin kurz in meinen Garten gehen? Marcus zu mir: Oder wird es dir zu kalt? Ich:Nein, aber nur wenn Lisa etwas Warmes zum überziehen mit hat. Lisa zu mir: Ich würde mich freuen, wenn du mitkommst, ich werde schon nicht erfrieren. Komm schon mit, lud sie mich ein und gab mir einen Kuss.</p>

<p>VG Martin </p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
hast Du immer noch Kontakt zu Lisa? 
Wie ging eigentlich der Abend im Garten weiter?</p>

<p>Deine Berichte zu den Weihnachtsmarktbesuchen sind ja leider recht knapp ausgefallen. Hast Du Lust noch etwas ausfuehrlicher zu schreiben? Wie lange wart ihr jeweils unterwegs? Der Grund fuer den Weihnachtsmarktbesuch ist ja meist nicht nur das nette Ambiente, sondern auch Essen und Trinken mehr oder weniger gesunder und kalorienarmer Leckereien. Wie hat sich Lisa dort geschlagen?</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred,
lange nichts mehr von euch gehört. 
Ja, ich habe noch gelegentlich Kontakt zu Lisa, auch während der Coronazeit, aber nur noch selten und kaum in der Öffentlichkeit, was ich sehr bedauere. 
Auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt waren wir oft mehrere Stunden unterwegs, einmal erinnere ich mich , haben wir uns gegen 16 Uhr getroffen und sind bis 22 Uhr geblieben. Du kannst dir sicher vorstellen, wie hart das für Lisa war. Es waren zwar keine Minustemperaturen, aber ich habe selbst in meiner Winterjacke gefroren und Lisa hat sich nicht einmal beschwert, wie kalt ihr gewesen sein muss. Gegessen hat sie kaum etwas, dafür wir umso mehr, ihr reichten ein paar Mandeln aus meiner Tüte und ab und zu ein Schluck von meinem Glühwein. Dafür habe ich beobachtet, dass sie in der Zeit fast zwei Schachteln Zigaretten geraucht hat. Ich habe sie versucht zu überzeugen, etwas weniger zu rauchen, auch weil sie ganz schlimm erkältet war. Sie legte ihren Arm um mich, ich spürte ihren zitternden Körper , sie hustete und zitterte dabei so stark, dass wir nicht weiter laufen konnten und während ich sie fest in meinen Armen hielt, fühlte ich ihre eiskalte Gänsehaut. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich es genoss , mitten im Gedränge unter all den winterlich gekleideten Menschen, dieses zarte Geschöpf in meinen Armen zu halten, dabei ihre nackten Arme und ihren nackten Rücken zu streicheln und zu wissen, dass mein Sohn Lisa keine Gelegenheit geben wird sich auch nur etwas aufzuwärmen. Doch mein Gewissen plagte mich und ich bot Lisa an: Lisa, so wie du frierst können wir nicht die ganze Zeit draußen bleiben, deine Lippen sind schon blau und deine Erkältung wird jeden Tag schlimmer, lass uns hier ins Kaufhaus gehen, dort kannst du dich etwas aufwärmen  und ich kaufe dir etwas zum überziehen. Sie lächelte mich an und erklärte mir mit klappernden Zähnen : Du hast ja recht, ich bin echt durchgefroren, wahrscheinlich auch durch meine Erkältung, Minirock und nackte Beine machen mir nichts aus, aber in dem winzigen Top ist es in dem kalten Wind echt frisch, lieb dass dir Sorgen machst, aber das Outfit hat dein Sohn ausgesucht und für ihn trage ich es gern. Komm gib mir doch bitte Feuer, dann werde ich auch nicht erfrieren. Ich zündete ihre x-te Zigarette, sie zog ganz tief daran und komischerweise ließ ihr Husten nach ein paar Zügen nach. Mein Sohn hatte unser Gespräch wahrscheinlich mitgehört, er entführte sie mir und fragte mich:
Gefällt dir Lisa ihr Outfit? Ich: Es ist viel zu kalt. Lisa: Kein Problem. </p>

<p>Gruezi ! Hab durch Corona alle Haende voll zu tun gehabt, mein Business am Absaufen zu hindern. War damit zwar hoechst erfolgreich, hab dadurch Carina aber leider mehr vernachlaessigt, als es gut fuer sie war. Wenn ich es nicht besser wuesste, koennte ich fast glauben, sie liest Martins Blogs und ahmt Lisas Trainingsplan nach. 
Is leider wieder die alte Geschichte: finde es rattenscharf wenn sie so ausgehungert ist und tapfer friert, hab aber dann gleichzeitig ein extrem schlechtes Gewissen und schaeme mich dafuer, dass es mich anmacht, wenn sie leidet fuer mich und mach mir natuerlich auch Sorgen, dass sie uebertreibt.
Nach der Episode, wo ich sie nicht in den eiskalten See hupfen lassen wollte, hat bald das Theater mit Corona begonnen und wir haben uns natuerlich deutlich weniger gesehen. Hab ihr zwar immer wieder klar gemacht, wie sehr ich sie vermisse und wie scharf ich auf sie bin, aber sie hat es trotzdem als mangelndes Interesse interpretiert. Habe bereits beim ersten unserer seltenen Treffen bemerkt, dass ihr Bauch noch eingesunkener war als sonst und dass ihre Rippen und Muskeln noch definierter waren. Obwohl sie extrem zerbrechlich gewirkt hat und offenbar staendig hungrig war, hab ich Depp sie noch bestaerkt, weil ich ihr wieder gesagt und gezeigt habe, wie geil ich ihren Koerper finde und weil ich sie wieder  erinnert habe, wie sexy ich es gefunden haben, dass sie damals in den eisigen Ozean gesprungen ist und wie sehr es mich anturnt, sie zu waermen. Auch wenn sie das sowieso weiss, war das glaube ich das erste Mal, dass ich explizit gesagt habe, dass ich das total verfuehrerisch finde. Prompt wollte sie beim nächsten Treffen, dass ich sie mit dem Auto abhole, weil sie &lt;&lt; heute noch nicht trainiert hat >>. Als sie mit mir in die Naehe des Sees wollte, dachte ich natuerlich, dass sie Joggen will. Waere das schon uebel: Es war stuermisch, es hat in Stroemen geregnet und es war eiskalt - typisches Maerzwetter halt. Sie war barfuss in ihren Sportschuhen und hatte einen duennen, grauen Trainingsanzug an und obwohl ich die Autoheizung aufgedreht habe, habe ich aus dem Augenwinkel doch gesehen, dass sie nur muehsam ihr froesteln unterdruecken konnte. Ich hab mein Auto dann neben dem See auf einen Parkplatz abgestellt, wobei mich bei dem Sauwetter keine 10 Roesser zum Austeigen bewegen haetten koennen ... keine 10 Roesser, aber ein zartes Maedchen, dass sich auszog und jetzt mit klappernden Zaehnen und - selbst im geheizten Auto - zitternd im Bikini neben mir sass. &lt;&lt; Ich bin in einer halben Stunde wieder da, laenger halt ich noch nicht aus. Ich friere jetzt schon extrem, aber das ist gut. Zittern verbrennt extrem viel Kalorien. Schau ! >> Sie nahm meine Hand und legte sie auf ihren Bauch. Abgesehen davon, dass ihre Haende eiskalt waren und sie bereits am Bauch eine Gaensehaut hatte, spuerte ich unter der Haut wirklich nur ihre Bauchmuskeln und ihren knurrenden Magen. Sie macht das immer, wenn sie mich verfuehren will. Ich streichelte ihr sanft ueber ihren schmalen Oberschenkel, der bereits merklich zu zittern begonnen hatte. &lt;&lt; Komm, lass das. Es ist noch kaelter, als beim letzten Mal. >> Ich weiss, das klang mehr als halbherzig. &lt;&lt; Wenn ich mich nachher bei dir aufwaermen darf, halte ich das aus. Ich spuer die Kaelte besonders intensiv, weil ich extrem hungrig bin. Ich faste seit 3 Tagen.  Aber ich bin stark. Ich steh das durch. >> Sie kuesste mich mit klappernden Zaehnen auf den Mund und stieg aus. Ich blieb kurz im Auto sitzen, ging aber dann doch hinter ihr nach, wobei ich mir trotz Regenschirm, Jacke und Pullover ungemein mutig vorkam, dass ich bei dem Regen da raus ging. Carina hatte offenbar auf mich gewartet. Sie war zwar schon durch den Regen komplett nass und bibberte vor Kaelte, aber der Hauptteil ihrer Tortur stand noch vor ihr. Ich bewundere immer den Mut, wenn sie ohne Zaudern in das eiskalte Wasser geht. Ich weiss nicht wie lange sie es wirklich ausgehalten hat ... mir kam es vor wie eine Ewigkeit. Als sie schließlich erschöpft aus dem eiskalten See stolperte, der selbst im Hochsommer maximal 15 Grad hat, blieb mir fast das Herz stehen. Carina schlotterte zwar vor Kaelte und ihre Lippen waren dunkelblau aber ihr Anblick war einfach atemberaubend. Ihre langen, schlanken Beine haben so gezittert, dass sie nicht mal richtig gehen konnte und auch ihr kleiner, knackiger Arsch bebte unkontrollierbar. Ihre Brustwarzen waren so hart, dass sie fast den Stoff des Bikinioberteils durchbohrten und ihre Hände zitternden so sehr, dass Carina es nicht schaffte, ihre schwarzen Locken aus dem Gesicht zu streifen. &lt;&lt; Bist echt ein tapferes Mädchen, Carina. >> Sie warf mir wieder diesen glühenden Blick zu, der so im krassen Gegensatz zum Anblick, dieses klatschnassen und bibbernden, dünnen Mädels stand, deren ausgehungerter Koerper von Kopf bis zu ihren blauelichen Zehen von einer Gaensehaut bedeckt war und die so zitterte und so erschoepft war, dass sie nur mit viel Muehe in den Wagen steigen konnte. Ich wollte sie zwar erst abtrocknen und etwas aufwaermen, aber irgendwie wollten wir in dieser Situation beide nur miteinander schlafen. Ich hab ihr den Bikini einfach heruntergerissen und mich nicht mal drum gekümmert, ob sonst noch wer auf dem Parkplatz war. Andererseits waren die Scheiben eh schnell beschlagen. ;-)
Carina hat trotz Heizung, Trainingsanzug und Jacke die ganze Heimfahrt unkontrolliert gezittert. Hab dann auch zuhause versucht, sie aufzuwaermen. Ich hab den ganzen  Abend nicht die Finger von ihr lassen können. </p>

<p>Hi IcemanX,
es freut mich dass du dein Business gut durch die Corona-Krise gebracht hast, aber vernachlässige Carina nicht zu sehr. Sie möchte dich sicher nicht verlieren, sonst würde sie nicht so eisern weiter hungrig trainieren, um dich rattenscharf zu machen. Es ist gut, dass du ihr gesagt hast, wie sexy du sie findest. Sie war sicher glücklich, dass sich ihre Mühen gelohnt haben. Aber bitte pass auf sie auf, dass sie nicht übertreibt. Ich kann dich verstehen, dass du ein schlechtes Gewissen hast. Geht mir mit Lisa genauso.  Ging mir auch bei dem Besuch in Marcus seinem Garten so. Ich wusste genau, wie eiskalt ihr nach dem Training im See sein musste. Nein, ehrlich gesagt kann ich es nur ahnen, wie kalt es sich anfühlen muss bei dieser Kälte in einem Bikini zu schwimmen und danach nass im eisigen Wind zu stehen. Ich fror schon in meinen dicken Klamotten und ich habe schon gesehen, dass Lisa für den Weg zum Garten nicht einmal ein Handtuch zum Überwerfen mit hatte. Trotzdem habe ich ihre Einladung angenommen und hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen, aber ich wollte die Gelegenheit auch nutzen, wieder mal mit Lisa zusammen zu sein, obwohl ich natürlich wusste, dass ich sie nicht so leidenschaftlich, wie du deine Carina, wärmen darf. Das bleibt Marcus vorbehalten. Auch Lisa ihre langen, schlanken Beine haben auf dem Weg in den Garten so gezittert, dass sie nicht mehr richtig gehen konnte, dazu kam ihr heftiger Husten, Marcus musste sie fest in seinem Arm nehmen und auch ihr kleiner, knackiger Arsch bebte unkontrollierbar. Ich musste Lisa meine Bewunderung mitteilen: "Lisa, deine Figur ist der Hammer" Lisa:"Das ist Marcus sein Verdienst, er ist einfach der beste Trainer"  Neidisch musste ich beobachten, wie Marcus seine Hand über ihren nackten Rücken in Richtung Po wanderte und Lisa lobte: "Langsam macht sich das Training bezahlt" und Lisa entgegnete:"Danke für deine Geduld" Als wir ankamen stellte Marcus fest, dass er den Schlüssel für das Gartenhaus nicht dabei hatte. Er konnte nur in den Schuppen, aus dem er uns ein Bier und die Auflage für die Schaukel holte und meinte zu mir: "Tut mir leid, dass wir hier draußen sitzen müssen, hoffentlich wird es dir nicht zu kalt" Ich sagte,obwohl mir echt kalt war: "Nein, passt schon. Aber Lisa kann doch nicht hier draußen bleiben" Dabei schaute ich zu Lisa, die gerade ihre Zigarette aus ihren zitternden Fingern verloren hatte und bei dem Versuch sie wieder aufzuheben die Kontrolle über ihren Körper verloren hatte. Sie zitterte und hustete so sehr, dass sie es nicht schaffte ihre Zigarette aufzuheben und sich anzustecken. Ich eilte zu Lisa, zog meine Jacke aus und hing sie ihr über ihre Schultern. Plötzlich hatte sie sich wieder etwas unter Kontrolle, sie zitterte zwar immer noch total, konnte aber wieder stehen, auch wenn ihre Zähne so stark klappernden, dass sie kaum zu verstehen war, streifte sie ab und gab sie mir zurück: "Ich brauche wirklich keine Jacke, bin nur etwas ausgekühlt, weil ich solange im Wasser war, fühle mich schon wieder viel wärmer. " Sie setzte sich zwischen uns auf die Schaukel und ich hatte wieder mal die Gelegenheit sie aus nächster Nähe zu betrachten, all ihre Muskeln zitterten unter ihrer bläulichen Gänsehaut, ich konnte ihre eiskalten Schenkel fühlen, spürte aber auch,wie schlimm erkältet sie war und redete ihr und Marco ins Gewissen, Lisa ihre Gesundheit nicht aufs Spiel zu setzen. Am Anfang ihrer Beziehung war Marcus sehr darauf bedacht, Lisa vor sich selbst zu schützen, das hatte sich aber im Laufe der Beziehung immer weiter reduziert, er entgegnete nur: Lisa ist echt hart im Nehmen,mach dir mal nicht so viele Sorgen...</p>

<p>Hallo Iceman, 
wie lief der Sommer? Hat sich Carina auch da etwas einfallen lassen, um dich zu beeindrucken?
So langsam wird es ja wieder spannender in Bezug auf zu wenig oder zu duenne Kleidung in Anbetracht des Wetters. Gab es schon erste Stunts von Carina? Hat sie besondere Plaene fuer Herbst und Winter?
Es gbit hier sicherlich viele interessierte, wenn auch schweigende Leser.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
hast Du noch Kontakt zu Lisa? Oder hat Dein Sohn sich eine neue Freundinn gesucht, die er jetzt genauso herausfordert?</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred,
Ja, mein Sohn hat mittlerweile wieder eine bildhübsche Freundin,sie ist erst 17 und hat eine super Figur, für die sie scheinbar nichts tun muss, sie isst riesige Eisbecher mit Sahne, Pommes mit Majo und auch sonst jede Menge süsse und fettige Sachen. Keine Ahnung, ob er sie herausfordert, im Sommer war sie immer sehr sexy gekleidet, ist ja noch sehr jung und damit auch nicht ungewöhnlich. Ich habe auch noch gelegentlich Kontakt zu Lisa, sie ist noch mit Marcus zusammen, wir haben die letzten Wochenenden gemeinsam einem befreundeten Winzer bei der Weinlese geholfen. Dort hat sie mir nach ein paar Gläsern Wein am Abend gebeichtet, dass sie meinen Sohn immer noch liebt und sie es sich nicht verzeihen kann, seinen Erwartungen nicht gerecht zu werden. Ich sass neben ihr und muss zugeben, dass ich es genoss, sie in den Arm zu nehmen und ihren durchtrainierten Körper zu spüren, der in der abendlichen Kühle merklich zitterte. Kein Wunder, denn während wir alle in dicken Klamotten im Garten sassen, trug Lisa nur ihre braungebrannte Gänsehaut und einen Bikini auf ihrem superschlanken Körper. So arbeitete sie schon den ganzen Tag im Weinberg und meinte, so könne sie noch die letzten Sonnenstrahlen genießen. Du kannst dir sicher vorstellen, wie gern die Männer im Weinberg in ihrer Nähe waren und ihr Zigaretten spendierten, da hatte ich keine Chance. Aber jetzt am Abend durfte ich Lisa eine Zigarette nach der anderen anzünden und ihr in meinem Arm etwas Wärme spenden. Ich machte ihr Komplimente und tröstete sie: Du hast immer alles für deine Partner getan, sogar deine Gesundheit aufs Spiel gesetzt. Ich habe noch nie eine so tolle Frau erlebt, die soweit geht, um die Erwartungen ihrer Partner zu erfüllen. Mein Sohn ist ein Idiot, sich von dir zu trennen. Trauere ihm nicht nach und genieße die Zeit mit Marcus. Aber bitte achte mehr auf dich. Du darfst nicht mehr soviel rauchen und musst wenigstens etwas mehr essen und vorallem musst du in der kühlen Jahreszeit wenigstens eine Jacke überziehen ... Lisa legte ihren Kopf auf meine Schulter, ihr liefen die Tränen: Du hast wahrscheinlich recht, aber ich kann den Idiot einfach nicht vergessen, ich liebe ihn immer noch, ich bin einfach nicht hart genug zu mir selbst gewesen, er hasst schwache und alte Frauen wie mich. Wenigstens liebt mich Marcus, obwohl ich viel älter bin, ist er stolz auf seine Freundin, da muss ich auf meine Figur achten, bin so fett, jedes Salatblatt setzt bei mir an und Rauchen unterdrückt das Hungergefühl, er trainiert mich so professionell, aber ich nehme einfach nicht ab. Marcus ist so lieb zu mir und macht mir keine Vorwürfe, obwohl er auf schlanke Frauen steht und ich trinke hier Wein und werde noch weiter zunehmen. Ich streichelte über ihren zitternden Oberschenkel : Lisa du hast eine hammerfigur, hier ist kein bisschen Fett, nur Muskeln. Du wirst hier bestimmt nicht zunehmen, du hast den ganzen Tag gearbeitet und nur früh etwas Müsli gegessen. Lisa nahm sich die letzte Zigarette aus der Schachtel, gab mir einen Kuss: Du bist so lieb zu mir und tröstest mich und ich heule mich bei dir aus. Bitte entschuldige und bitte erzähle nichts Marcus. Ich darauf: Keine Angst, ich werde ihm nichts von unserem Gespräch sagen. Ich habe nur manchmal Angst um dich. Dabei umarmte ich sie ganz fest und genoss es ihre kalte Gänsehaut auf ihrem nackten Rücken zu fühlen. Ich bat Lisa aufzustehen, damit ich an ihr vorbei um den Tisch gehen konnte: Ich hole uns noch ein Glas Wein. Lisa lächelte wieder, drückte die letzten Zigarette aus und stand nun in ihrem Bikini direkt vor mir. Ich sass noch auf meinem Stuhl und konnte im kerzenschein ihren geilen zitternden Körper bewundern, der vollkommen in Gänsehaut gehüllt war, mir stockte der Atem, ich verlor meine Kontrolle und streichelte mit beiden Händen über die kalte Gänsehaut  auf ihrer Hüfte, spürte sie intensiv auf ihren Hüftknochen  und weiter an den zitternden Oberschenkel, ich fing mich wieder und sagte schnell: Ich bringe dir eine Decke mit. Lisa meinte jetzt mit klappernden Zähnen: Nur wenn du meine Gänsehaut nicht mehr magst. Ich stand auf streichelte ihren Rücken und flüsterte ihr ins Ohr: und ob ich die mag, weißt du doch schon lange, aber Du frierst doch schon so heftig. Lisa ihre Zähne klapperten immer noch, ich spürte beim vorbeigehen wieder ihren zitternden Körper, sie schmiegte sich an mich und flüsterte mir ins Ohr : ohne frieren keine Gänsehaut, bin ich doch gewöhnt, brauche keine Decke, aber vielleicht ein bisschen wärme von dit und unbedingt noch Zigaretten....</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
vielen Dank fuer das Update.
Du wirst ja sicherlich bald herausfinden, ob die neue Freundin Deines Sohnes sich ebenfalls in der kuehleren Jahreszeit sommerlich kleidet / kleiden muss.
Lisa scheint ja noch genauso "cool" drauf zu sein, wie in der letzten Saison. Sind Dein Sohn und Marcus eigentlich noch befreundet und unternehmen noch gemeinsam etwas?</p>

<p>War Marcus nicht mit bei der Weinlese bzw. am Umtrunk danach dabei? Hat Lisa dir erzaehlt, dass sie nur am Morgen ein Muesli hatte? Konnte sie denn bei der koerperlichen Arbeit den ganzen Tag da gut mithalten? Was fuer einen Bikini-Style traegt sie denn bei solchen Anlaessen? Eher konservativ, Brasilien-Style oder String? Spaetestens als sie anfing zu frieren, war so ein Oberteil sicherlich deeer Hingucker ;-)</p>

<p>Kennst Du Lisas Uebungsprogramm? Was hat sie fuer den Winter geplant?</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
möchte dir noch kurz deine Fragen beantworten, aber auch nicht zu viel Privates preisgeben. </p>

<p>Sind Dein Sohn und Marcus eigentlich noch befreundet und unternehmen noch gemeinsam etwas?</p>

<p>Ja, sie sind noch befreundet und unternehmen auch gelegentlich etwas zusammen, das macht es Lisa vielleicht auch so schwer ihn zu vergessen. </p>

<p>War Marcus nicht mit bei der Weinlese bzw. am Umtrunk danach dabei? </p>

<p>Nein, ich war mit Lisa an dem Wochenende allein dort, da Marcus und mein Sohn verhindert waren, habe mich natürlich gefreut, dass Lisa mich trotzdem begleitet hat.</p>

<p>Hat Lisa dir erzaehlt, dass sie nur am Morgen ein Muesli hatte?</p>

<p>Ja, ich habe sie in der Frühe abgeholt und wir haben auf dem Weg in einer Tankstelle gefrühstückt. Ich habe uns zwei Kaffee geholt und sie gefragt, was sie essen möchte. Lisa: Ich esse früh nie etwas, aber heute habe ich mal gesündigt und mich schon früh  mit Müsli vollgestopft. Dabei strich sie über ihren nackten Bauch. Sie trug schon früh, als ich sie abholte nur einen Minirock über ihrem Bikini und meinte: Wird bestimmt anstrengend heute. Das muss nun reichen, aber bring noch zwei Schachteln Zigaretten mit. </p>

<p>Konnte sie denn bei der koerperlichen Arbeit den ganzen Tag da gut mithalten? </p>

<p>Ja, sie konnte erstaunlich gut mithalten. Hier hilft sicher auch ihr Schwimmtraining und ihr haben die Männer gern geholfen. </p>

<p>Was fuer einen Bikini-Style traegt sie denn bei solchen Anlaessen? Eher konservativ, Brasilien-Style oder String? </p>

<p>Kenne mich mit dem Style nicht so aus. Oberteil als Neckholder und hinten eine Schnur zum Binden. Da Lisa sehr schlank ist hat sie auch nur eine kleine Oberweite, muss nicht so viel gestützt werden , und der Rücken bleibt komplett frei.</p>

<p>Spaetestens als sie anfing zu frieren, war so ein Oberteil sicherlich deeer Hingucker ;-)</p>

<p>Und ob, so ein Teil verdeckt fast nichts, kannst du dir sicher vorstellen, sie trägt auch sonst meist dünne Neckholder Shirts, die echte Hingucker sind ;-)</p>

<p>Kennst Du Lisas Uebungsprogramm? Was hat sie fuer den Winter geplant?</p>

<p>Ich nehme an sie wird ihr Schwimmtraining solange sie durchhalten kann, weiter fortsetzen. </p>

<p>Hallo Martin, 
schade, dass es hier so ruhig geworden ist im Forum, aber vielleicht meldet sich jetzt, wo das Wetter wieder "interessanter" wird, der ein oder andere wieder an dieser Stelle und teilt seine Erlebnisse und Beobachtungen.</p>

<p>Mittlerweile hast Du sicherlich herausgefunden, ob dein Sohn auch die neue Freundin von sommerlicher Kleidung im Winter ueberzeugt.</p>

<p>Interessant wuerde es dann, wenn Lisa und die neue Freundin deines Sohnes zusammentreffen, z.B. bei einem Winterurlaub zu viert ...</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Es ist wirklich schade, dass es hier so ruhig geworden ist. Ich muss dich enttäuschen, mein Sohn war gestern mit seiner neuen Freundin bei mir. Sie war sehr sexy gekleidet, sie trug ein wirklich kurzes Kleid, aber der  Jahreszeit entsprechend mit blickdichter Strumpfhose und einer leichten Jacke. Kein Vergleich zu Lisa, die ich auch am Wochenende mit Marcus getroffen habe, so wie ich sie kenne, barfuss im Minirock und knappen Top. Sie lachte und scherzte, wie immer, obwohl sie sicher schon wieder total durchgefroren war. Klar hatte ich schon bei der Begrüßung bemerkt,dass sie noch weiter abgenommen hat und wie sehr ihr ausgehungerter und durchtrainierter Körper zitterte, doch erst als ich mit ihr allein vor dem Shop auf Marcus wartete und sie mir Fotos auf ihrem Handy zeigen wollte und ihr das kaum gelang, wurde mir bewusst, wie kalt ihr sein musste. Ich nahm sie in den Arm, streichelte ihre Gänsehaut auf der Schulter und auf dem Arm und sagte: Lisa, du bist ja noch schlanker geworden. Lisa küsste mich auf die Wange: Danke, wenigstens hast du es bemerkt, Marcus ist es noch nicht aufgefallen. Ich: Habe ich sofort gesehen, aber auch wie sehr du frierst,  bitte geh mit rein, so kannst du dich ein wenig aufwärmen. Ihre Zähne klapperten so stark, dass sie kaum sprechen konnte: Klar friere ich, barfuss ist jetzt schon ziemlich hart, aber Marcus steht darauf, bin seit früh nur draußen unterwegs und war schon im See schwimmen, bin heute echt durchgefroren, aber was soll's, in deinem Arm fühle ich mich gleich viel wärmer oder möchtest du mich wirklich weg schicken?  Sie drückte ihren zitternden Körper an mich: Nein, ich sehe dich so selten, aber ich habe Angst um dich...</p>

<p>Hi IcemanX, 
Wie geht es dir und Carina?</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
vielleicht hast Du ja von Zeit zu Zeit Updates zu berichten. Dann bleibt das Forum am Leben und irgendwann melden sich wieder andere zum Thema. Oder man muesste "Werbung" machen bei aehnlichen Fragestellungen, die aber auch nicht so aktiv sind. Vielleicht muessten wir auch wieder auf Englisch wechseln.
Schade, dass dein Sohn seine neue Freundin nicht auch zu sommerlicher Kleidung im Winter anregt. Aber vielleicht kommt das ja noch. </p>

<p>Ich haette es mir schon interessant vorgestellt, wenn sie mal etwas zu viert unternommen haetten <em>breites Grinsen</em>.</p>

<p>Eine schoene Adventszeit und haltet die Augen auf.</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Neues gibt es nicht zu berichten, im Prinzip haben wir uns schon über alle Aspekte ausgetauscht, ursprünglich hatte ich hier über Lisa gepostet, weil ich mir nicht sicher war, ob mein Sohn nicht übertreibt, Lisa indirekt unter Druck zu setzen, ihre Figur nach seiner Idealvorstellung zu verändern und unabhängig von der Witterung zu zeigen. Das führte dazu, dass sie fast nur noch von Zigaretten und starkem Kaffee lebte und bis zur Erschöpfung trainierte, um weiter abzunehmen. Ich steckte in dem Widerspruch Lisa einerseits vor meinem Sohn zu beschützen, finde es aber andererseits faszinierend ihren mittlerweile durchtrainierten schlanken Körper zu erleben. Noch mehr bin ich von ihrer Fähigkeit fasziniert, ihren minimalen Kleidungsstil auch in der grössten Kälte durchzuhalten. Ich habe noch nie eine Frau erlebt, die so tapfer über Stunden, manchmal wirklich fast nichts auf ihrer Gänsehaut trägt und in der grössten Kälte alles mitmacht. Sie ist dabei immer fröhlich und hat gute Laune, auch wenn ihr anzusehen ist, wie sehr sie frieren muss. Meine größte Sorge ist dabei ihre Gesundheit. Sie war wirklich oft krank, ist eigentlich ständig erkältet und wie ich mitbekommen habe hat sie auch mehrfach eine Blasenentzündung und sogar eine Lungenentzündung gehabt. Das hat sie mir später mal gebeichtet und war auch der Grund, warum sie damals auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt aufgegeben hat, meinen Mantel angenommen und mich, nach einem heftigen Streit  mit meinem Sohn, gebeten hat sie nach Hause zu begleiten. Dieser Streit und mein Vorwurf an ihn, Lisas Gesundheit aufs Spiel zu setzen, war auch der Auslöser für seine Trennung von Lisa. Nach der Trennung achtete Lisa ein wenig mehr auf sich, auch am Anfang ihrer Beziehung mit Marcus trug sie manchmal eine Jacke, doch es dauerte nicht lange und Lisa trainierte noch intensiver und in einer Jacke habe ich Lisa auch nicht mehr gesehen. 
Findest du, dass ich auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt falsch gehandelt habe. Vielleicht wären die beiden sonst noch zusammen? 
Ein gemeinsamer Urlaub wäre sicher interessant, aber wegen Corona erstmal nicht möglich. </p>

<p>VG Martin </p>

<p>Hi, ich melde mich auch wieder mal. Ab und zu hab ich hier reingeschaut, um zu sehen, was es Neues gibt, aber hatte nicht wirklich interessante Erlebnisse zu berichten. Bis heute.</p>

<p>Seit einiger Zeit schreibe ich nämlich schon mit einem Mädel, das ich über Instagram kennengelernt habe. Für diesen Beitrag hier nenne ich sie einfach mal Lara. Wir haben uns ziemlich gut verstanden und ab und an auch mal gegenseitig Bilder geschickt. Jetzt haben wir uns einfach mal für ein kleines Fotoshooting getroffen. In der Stadt, in der wir uns getroffen haben, hatte es heute 2 bis 3 Grad. Der Schnee von vor ein paar Tagen lag leider nicht mehr.</p>

<p>Vorgestern hat Lara viele ihrer Kleidungsstücke fotografiert und wir haben beraten, in welchen wir sie shooten wollen. Ziemlich schnell waren wir uns einig, dass die sommerlichen definitiv mehr hermachen, und wir haben uns dann für vier Outfits entschieden, von denen am Ende allerdings nur drei zum Einsatz kamen.</p>

<p>Das erste war ein roter Samtjumpsuit mit kurzen Beinchen und langen Ärmeln, mit der Besonderheit, dass fast der ganze Rücken frei liegt. Das zweite war ein kurzes, blaues, sehr schön schimmerndes Kleid. Auch langärmelig, dafür aber auch mit großzügigem Rückenausschnitt und auch einem breiten Dekolleté, das die Schlüsselbeine schön zeigt. Als Schuhe zu den beiden haben wir schwarze Stiefeletten mit Blockabsatz gewählt. Lara hat sich dann auch noch für eine schwarze Strumpfhose entschieden, denn es war schon sehr kalt und außerdem zeigt sie ihre Beine anscheinend nicht ganz so gerne (was ich gar nicht
nachvollziehen kann).</p>

<p>Das dritte Outfit war eine Camouflage-Jeans mit super-skinny Fit und einem schwarzen Mesh-Top mit Maschen von etwa einem Zentimeter. Wir hatten geplant, dass sie dann unter dem Top noch ein schwarzes Bustier trägt. Für diesen eher coolen Look fanden wir dann flache Schuhe besser. Die waren dunkelrot und vom Stil her ähnlich wie niedrige Dr. Martens.</p>

<p>Ich hab mich sehr auf das Shooting gefreut und war gespannt, wie Lara sich in den ja nicht ganz winterfesten Outfits schlagen würde. Wir haben uns also am Bahnhof getroffen und sind zu einem nahegelegenen Park gefahren, wo wir uns dann an einem kleinen Teich loszulegen entschieden haben. Lara hat dann ganz unerschrocken erstmal Jacke und diverse Oberteile abgelegt und den Jumpsuit angezogen. Es war nicht so viel los im Park, sodass nicht allzu viele Leute beim Umziehen zugeschaut haben. Ich habe es aber ehrlich gesagt schon ein wenig genossen, denn sie hat eine tolle Figur. Zurzeit wiegt sie 46 kg bei 1,64 m und ist auch recht definiert. Die Arme, die sie selbst als zu $%!@ empfindet, würde ich zum Beispiel eher als schlank und trainiert bezeichnen. Um den rückenfreien Look im Jumpsuit nicht zu ruinieren, trug sie einen rückenfreien Klebe-BH.</p>

<p>Mit dem Jumpsuit haben wir uns also "warmgeschossen". Naja, zumindest war Lara zu Beginn noch recht warm, das hatte sich dann nach etwa 10 Minuten auch gelegt.  Nach einer kurzen Minute zum Aufwärmen in einer mitgebrachten Decke stand der erste Outfitwechsel an. Genauso unerschrocken, aber schon deutlich fröstelnder, hat Lara sich also wieder umgezogen. Das blaue Kleid sah in echt nochmal deutlich kleiner aus als auf den Bildern, die sie mir gesendet hatte.  Es war schon ziemlich kurz und vor allem sehr enganliegend, sodass man schön Laras Rippen durch das Kleid sehen konnte.</p>

<p>Als wir uns dann wieder ans Shooten machten, war ihr ganzer Rücken im ersten Moment voller Gänsehaut. Das hat sich dann aber bald gelegt. Dass ihr kalt war, wusste ich zwar, sehen konnte ich davon aber nichts mehr, denn sie hat sich echt nichts anmerken lassen. Fast wie ein professionelles Model! Nach einigen Bildern hat sie sich dann wieder eine Jacke übergezogen und wir haben den nächsten Ort zum Shooten gesucht.</p>

<p>Dort haben wir dann wieder Bilder im selben Outfit gemacht. Lara war zu dem Zeitpunkt schon eiskalt und sie ist ab und zu ein wenig rumgehüpft, damit ihr warm wird. Nach einiger Zeit hat sie sich dann in der Decke wieder aufgewärmt.  Eigentlich wollten wir dann noch zu einem weiteren Ort laufen, wo wir Bilder machen wollten. Aber Lara war dann so kalt, dass wir lieber erstmal einen nahegelegenen Laden besucht haben, um uns aufzuwärmen. (Cafés taugen zurzeit zu sowas ja schlecht.)</p>

<p>Nachdem wir uns dort ein wenig aufgewärmt hatten, sind wir dann mit dem Bus zum nächsten Ort gefahren. Dort haben wir dann auch nochmal Bilder in dem blauen Kleid gemacht. Eigentlich war Lara sich nicht sicher, ob sie nochmal einen Outfitwechsel schafft, aber dann hat sie sich doch dazu durchgerungen und wir haben uns für das Mesh-Top mit der Camo-Jeans entschieden. Eigentlich hatten wir ja an ein Bustier für unter das Top gedacht, aber Lara hat mich gefragt, ob sie das überhaupt anziehen soll. Tja, am Ende haben wir entschieden, dass der Klebe-BH reichen muss. Das war dann nochmal ein echt tolles Outfit zum Abschluss, denn ihr Oberkörper war durch die Maschen echt toll zu sehen und wir haben ein paar tolle Bilder von ihren Rippen und ihrem definierten Schulterbereich inklusive Schulterknochen bekommen. Der Ort gab auch genug her, um ein paar sportliche Posen auszuprobieren.</p>

<p>Anschließend war Lara echt ziemlich durchgefroren, denn das Mesh-Top hat natürlich überhaupt nicht warm gegeben. Sie war ziemlich stolz darauf, das Shooting in der Kälte so durchgehalten zu haben. Leider sieht man auf den Bildern nicht, wie kalt es wirklich war.</p>

<p>Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass ihr jetzt natürlich gerne Bilder sehen würdet.  Ich weiß nicht, was Lara davon hält, aber ich werde sie mal fragen, ob wir ein oder zwei hier reinstellen können.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,</p>

<p>natuerlich sind schon viele Gedanken zum Thema ausgetauscht. Unabhaengig davon ist es dennoch interessant, wie sich Lisa so in diesem Winter schlaegt.</p>

<p>Eine Frage erschliesst sich mir noch nicht: Deinem Sohn scheint es ja wichtig zu sein, dass seine Freundin schlank ist. Anders als in den Ausfuehrungen von Iceman scheint es fuer ihn nicht so wichtig zu sein, dass seine Freundin sich so quaelt, um diese Figur zu erhalten. Auch die duenne Kleidung im Winter scheint ihm nicht so wichtig zu sein - oder hast Du bei seiner neuen Freundin in der Zwischenzeit etwas Aehnliches beobachtet?</p>

<p>Also, wie kam es dazu, dass er von Lisa ein solches Verhalten "erwartete"? Oder hat es Lisa selbst so provoziert?</p>

<p>Manche Antwort koennen wir dazu wahrscheinlich nur von Lisa selbst erhalten. Koenntest Du Dir vorstellen, dass sie sich selbst hier zu Wort meldet mit oder ohne Markus?</p>

<p>Weihnachtliche Gruesse</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Leider muss ich dich enttäuschen, Lisa und Markus wissen nicht, dass ich hier über sie schreibe und ich habe mich deshalb auch schon gefragt, ob ich hier überhaupt über sie schreiben darf. 
Zu deinen weiteren Fragen. Wenn ich den Eindruck erweckt habe, dass es meinen Sohn nicht wichtig ist eine schlanke Freundin zu haben, dann ist das definitiv falsch. Schon als er Lisa kennengelernt hat war sie sehr schlank, aber er hat ihr immer wieder verstehen zu geben, dass er von Lisa erwartet noch weiter abzunehmen. Fand ich ziemlich unfair, Gerade im Sommer hat er Lisa immer wieder mit viel jüngeren noch schlankeren Mädels verglichen. Er schaute diesen Mädels nach und fragte Lisa: Hast du gesehen, wie schlank DIE war? Wenn Lisa schon den ganzen Tag kaum etwas gegessen hatte und dadurch immer kraftloser wurde, ihr Magen laut knurrte,  und sie am Abend einen Salat mit Dressing  bestellen wollte, meinte er: Aber Lisa, doch nicht mit Dressing, denk an deine Diät. Lisa erschrak und meinte zum Kellner: Stimmt, bringen sie mir nur einen Espresso, der muss reichen und macht mich wieder fit. Mein Sohn zündete ihr eine Zigarette an, streichelte zärtlich ihren nackten Rücken und ihre Schenkel und ermahnte Lisa: Das glaube ich auch, alles andere wird nur zu Fett  und das möchten wir doch beide nicht. Das war auch die Zeit in der Lisa sich zur starken Raucherin entwickelte. Sie ist bis heute nicht mehr davon losgekommen, kaum ist eine Zigarette aus braucht sie schon die nächste. Sie sagt mir nicht wie viel sie wirklich raucht, aber ich habe schon mehrfach erlebt, dass ich zwei Schachteln Zigaretten für sie gekauft habe und sie mich nach ein paar Stunden gebeten hat, ihr Nachschub zu beschaffen. 
Genauso wichtig und im Winter  vielleicht sogar noch wichtiger ist ihm die knappe Kleidung. Schliesslich hat er meist die Klamotten für Lisa ausgesucht. Sicher hat ihm Lisa anfangs damit beeindrucken wollen, auch nachdem ich ihr diese Vorliebe von meinem Sohn anvertraut habe und mich noch heute mein schlechtes Gewissen plagt. Ich glaube er geniesst es regelrecht, dass sich Lisa für ihn quälte. Habe ja schon mal geschrieben, dass es für mich in Richtung SM geht. Ich habe es oft so empfunden und bewundere noch heute, was sie auf sich nimmt,  um die Männerwelt, einschließlich meiner Person,  zu beeindrucken. Habe schon mal vor längerer Zeit über unsere gemeinsame Schlittenfahrt geschrieben, du kannst dir nicht vorstellen, wie durchgefroren Lisa schon war und er ihr auch noch die Decke von ihren nackten zitternden Beinen weggenommen hat oder ich mehrfach erleben durfte, dass er Lisa total durchgefroren und stark erkältet mit schon bläulicher Gänsehaut aufgefordert hat noch eine Runde im See zu schwimmen oder mit seinen Kumpels zum nächsten Glühweinstand zu wechseln. Ein Kumpel verabschiedete sich, weil ihm und vor allem seiner Freundin zu kalt war.Dabei nahm er Lisa in den Arm, fühlte ihre zitternde Gänsehaut, die wie so oft nichts als einen Minirock und ein knappes Bandeau Top trug und fragte sie: Lisa, du bist so eiskalt, hast überall Gänsehaut, wie du zitterst und bist schon wieder erkältet, ich habe dich noch nie in warmen Klamotten gesehen, aber es ist heute doch so kalt und du mit so viel nackter Haut. Warum trägt du keine Winterklamotten ? - Lisa hatte längst die Kontrolle über ihren Körper verloren und hustete mit klappernden Zähnen: Oh ja, bin schon echt durchgefroren, aber die Klamotten hat mein Schatz für mich ausgesucht. Er mag es etwas freizügiger und ich kann ihn doch nicht enttäuschen.  Seine Freunde und auch ich drängten zum Aufbruch und versuchten Lisa zu überzeugen wenigstens eine Jacke oder Pullover überzuziehen. Mein Sohn prüfte immer intensiver ihre Gänsehaut: Bist echt eiskalt, aber ich finde dich heiss in deinem Outfit. Er streichelte weiter zärtlich ihren zitternden Körper und küsste Lisa: Ich mag deine Gänsehaut. Dicke Winterklamotten verdecken viel zu viel, aber wenn es dir zu kalt wird, kannst du natürlich meine Jacke bekommen. Lisa verlor kurz die Kontrolle über ihren Körper verlor, fing sich aber sofort wieder und stammelte mit klappernden Zähnen: Danke Schatz, ich brauche wirklich keine Jacke, höchstens eine  Zigarette, in deiner Nähe ist mir niemals zu kalt. Mein Sohn strahlte:  Seht ihr Lisa möchte wirklich keine Jacke, ihr macht die Kälte nichts aus. Er zündete Lisa eine Zigarette an und fragte Lisa: Gut dann hole ich uns noch einen Glühwein, es macht dir doch nichts aus, wenn wir noch bleiben?  Ohne eine Antwort abzuwarten holte er noch eine Runde Glühwein. Ich nahm Lisa fest in den Arm, ihre Gänsehaut war eiskalt und schimmerte bläulich, sie  schaffte es mit ihrer eiskalten zitternden Hand kaum ihre Zigarette zu halten und hustete ganz schlimm und konnte kaum allein stehen und zitterte am ganzen Körper. Ich versuchte sie zu überzeugen, meine Jacke anzuziehen. Sie klammerte sich an mich, küsste mich mit ihren blauen Lippen auf die Wange: Danke Martin. Oh Gott ist mir kalt, der kalte Wind kühlt mich immer weiter aus, der Glühwein wird mich wieder aufwärmen, alles für ein wenig Wärme,  aber bitte keine Jacke, wenn ich nur nicht so Zittern würde, aber das hilft beim Abnehmen. Als mein Sohn zurück kam, lief ihm Lisa entgegen und stand zitternd vor ihm: Danke für den Glühwein, der wird mich wieder aufwärmen. Er lächelte sie an: Ich habe an deine Figur gedacht und dir ein Wasser mitgebracht, du musst dich nicht aufwärmen, ich finde dich heiß, wenn du Gänsehaut trägst, die auch im Winter zeigst und dafür noch weiter abnehmen möchtest .
 Die geschilderte Situation zeigt für mich ziemlich deutlich, wie wichtig ihm bei Lisa war, dass sie sich für ihre schlanke Linie und dünne und freizügige Klamotten in der grössten Kälte quälte. Das er das bei seiner jetzigen Freundin nicht so konsequent zeigt, liegt meiner Meinung daran, dass er sie nicht wirklich liebt. Er findet sie vorallem gut, weil sie noch so jung ist. 
Meinst du ich habe schuld,dass er sich von Lisa getrennt hat?
Ich wollte Lisa schützen, aber manchmal bereue ich es heute. </p>

<p>Hi, ferfred, Martin und Co.
Hab mich lange nicht gemeldet. Der Sommer is ja immer oed ;-) und die Viruskacke ist auch nicht hilfreich. Aber einen Stunt, wie du es nennst, hat sie vor wenigen Wochen doch abgeliefert und auch wenn sie mir die ueblichen Gewissenbisse beschert hat, war ihr verfruehtes Weihnachtsgeschenk durchaus geeignet mein Hirn zu frittieren. Immer wenn wir uns berufsbedingt einige Wochen nicht sehen und mir das Testosteron schon aus den Ohren kommt wie einem Moench im Pornoladen tut sie sowas. Hab wegen einem Großauftrag nach Deutschland muessen, wobei meine Abreise mit einem heftigen Streit verbunden war, weil sie total Panik geschoben hat, dass ich mich anstecke und krank werd. Dass solche Auftraege dafuer sorgen, dass mein Business weiter gut laeuft und i net bin wie die Herren im Altersheim, war ihr nicht beizubringen. Ich liebe sie ja auch dafuer, dass ihr Geld egal ist und dass sie sich um mich sorgt ist suess, aber da haben halt der rationale Business-Owner und das leidenschaftlich Italo-Hippiemaedchen andere Ansichten. Habe ihr daher fuer einige Wochen die kalte Schulter gezeigt und auch nach meiner Rueckkehr keine Anstalten gemacht, sie zu treffen. Das selbe Spiel wie immer: Sie vertraut darauf, dass ich ihr nicht widerstehen kann und schickt sexy Handyfotos die ihren Waschbrettbauch, ihre blanken Rippen und langen Beine betonen, schreibt mir, wie hart sie trainiert für mich, um dann in einem geschickt plazierten Nebensatz quasi darum zu betteln, dass ich ihren staendig knurrenden Bauch streichle damit sie der Hunger nicht so quaelt weil sie seit 3 Tagen fastet, damit ihr Koerper so fettfrei ist, wie ich das mag. Natuerlich mag ich das, will aber auch wie der Ritter die Prinzessin von ihren Qualen erloesen und  lasse mich - wie jeder HeteroTyp - nur zu gern in dieser Situation verfuehren. Zu ihrem Pech war ich nach dem erfolgreichen Businesstrip aber so ueberdreht, dass mein Sadotrieb die Oberhand gewonnen hat und ich wild entschlossen war, wiedermal Carinas Leidensfaehigkeit auszuloten. In Nachhinein tut sie mir ja extrem leid, weil ich zwar einerseits total auf ihren Koerper abfahre, aber sie auch liebe. Umgekehrt gilt das selbe wie fuer Lisa: Sie tut es freiwillig und am Ende des Tages, fühlt sie sich tapfer und begehrenswert, was sie (und Lisa) auch ist und der Umstand, dass es so weh getan hat und sie sich so ueberwinden musste um diese Anerkennung zu bekommen, ist offenbar der Kick. Je hungriger sie ist und je mehr sie friert und je mehr sie das Gefuehl hat, kaempfen zu muessen, um so leidenschaftlicher und heisser wird sie. 
Der Fisch hat den Koeder also geschluckt, die zarte Anglerin aber leider - im wörtlichen Sinne - ins eiskalte Wasser gezogen. Hab ihr zurueck geschrieben, dass ich immer verrueckt danach bin, zaertlich ihren ausgehungerten Bauch und die blanken Rippen zu streicheln, es aber verstehe, dass sie nicht noch drei Tage hungern kann, weil ich vorher keine Zeit habe und mich spontan melden wuerde. Mir war natuerlich klar, dass sie weiter fasten und trainieren wuerde, damit sie bei unserem Treffen in Topfrom ist, weshalb ich mich nach 2 weiteren Tagen mit ihr verabredet habe. Carina hat ohnedies einen extrem geringen Koerperfettanteil und ich will sie natuerlich nicht gefaehrden, indem ich sie noch laenger zappeln lasse. Ihre zarte Figur zu spueren und ihre dunklen, lockigen Haare zu riechen, als sie mir leidenschaftlich um den Hals gefallen ist .. am liebsten haette ich ihr die Kleider vom Leib gerissen, aber so leicht wollte ich es ihr nicht machen. Sie seufzte tief: &lt;&lt; Du willst einen Liebesbeweis ? >> Sie hatte dieses Klitzern in den Augen, diese Mischung aus Herausforderung, Leidenschaft und Unsicherheit. Sie schluepfte aus ihrem Pullover und stand trotz 2 Grad nur mit einer Jean und einem hautengem Tanktop da. Der erste Windhauch und ihre Brustwarzen waren unter dem Stoff deutlich zu sehen, der zweite und sie hatte eine Gaensehaut auf ihrem perfekten Waschbrettbauch, der dritte und sie begann zu zittern. Mit einem schuechternen Laecheln, strich sie ueber ihren tief eingesunkenen Bauch und ihre Rippen. Sie war sexy as hell, doch zu ihrem Entsetzen versuchte ich, keine Notiz davon zu nehmen. Obwohl ich die Heizung im Auto nicht eingeschaltet habe und sie sichtbar fror, warf sie ihren Pullover trotzig auf den Ruecksitz und rollte sich wie eine frierende, kleine Katze neben mir auf den Beifahrersitz zusammen. Ich versuchte mich auf die dunkle Strasse zu konzentrieren. Trotz meines relativen lauten SUVs hoerte ich deutlich das Klappern ihrer Zaehne und ihr Magenknurren. Irgendwann habe ich dann doch meine Hand auf ihren Bauch gelegt. Sie war eiskalt, ihre Bauchmuskeln zitterten leicht und ich habe deutlich gespürt, wie das Pulsieren ihrer Bauchschlagader durch meine Beruehrung schneller wurde. Sie hielt meine Hand auf ihrem Bauch fest, der gerade wieder heftig knurrte. &lt;&lt; Ich bin so hungrig. Aber ... wenn dir das gefaellt, dann halt ich alles aus.>> Sie zog meine Hand zu ihrem Gesicht. Ihre seidenweiche Haut fühlte sich so gut an, auch wenn ihre Lippen blau waren und leicht bebten. Ich fuhr abrupt zum Straßenrand und trat heftig auf die Bremse. Die Parkbucht war genau neben dem See und abgelegen.  Carina hat mich total erschrocken angeschaut, aber ich hab in diesem Moment einfach frische Luft gebraucht. Ich bin raus aus dem Wagen und die paar Schritte zum Ufer. Es gab dort nur eine Strassenlampe und in der Ferne die Lichter ansonsten war es stockdunkel. Carina stolperte hinter mir nach. Sie hatte weiter keinen Pullover und das Licht der Strassenbeleuchtung warf auf ihren Koerper harte Schatten und liess sie noch ausgehungerter aussehen, als sie war. Ich wollte sie einerseits waermen, andererseits fand ich es unbeschreiblich geil, wenn meine ausgehungerte Schneeelfe vor Kaelte bibberte. Ich nahm sie in den Arm und waermte sie mit meinem Anorak. Jetzt war es vorbei. Ich hab sie zart in den Nacken gekuesst. &lt;&lt; Ich liebe dich und du bist so unbeschreiblich heiss ... und eiskalt. >> &lt;&lt; Ja, ich friere. Aber ... auch das halt ich aus.>> &lt;&lt; Dann zieh dich aus und geh ins Wasser.>>. Ich weiss nicht was mich mehr erschreckt hat: Meine eigene Grausamkeit, dieses zarte, frierende Maedchen so zu quaelen oder dass sie ohne Widerworte mit zittrigen Fingern ihre Jean aufknoepfte, sich auszog und mit einem verfuehrerischen Laecheln in das bitterkalte Wasser gewatet ist. Klar war es die Hoelle fuer sie, aber der Anblick dieser schlanken, vor Kaelte bibberten Elfe, der im Schein der Strassenlampe das eiskalte Wasser über den zitternden Koerper geronnen ist, war wie eine Szene aus einer Hollywoodromanze. Carina tauchte mehrmals unter und stolperte schließlich zitternd auf mich zu. So sehr frieren habe ich sie noch nie erlebt, obwohl die Wassertemperatur 13 Grad und die Luft 2 Grad hatte. &lt;&lt; Liebesbeweis ... >> Sie laechelte mich mit klapperten Zaehnen an und stand nackt, nass und bibbernd vor mir. Es war ein unbeschreibliches Gefuehl, sie in den Arm zu nehmen und zu waermen. &lt;&lt; Schlaf mit mir. Hier. Jetzt. Waerme mich. Bitte. >> diese Fluestern in mein Ohr und das Zaehneklappern dabei ... ich bin halb durchgedreht. Und ja, ich hab sie gewaermt. No, na. Obwohl ich ihr danach den Pullover angezogen habe und meinen noch drueber, sie mit meiner Jacke zugedeckt habe und die Heizung jetzt auf Vollgas lief, hat sie noch immer gezittert, als wir nach Hause zu mir gekommen sind. Hab sie also - und das hat auch schon Tradition - ins Bett getragen. Hatte wsg ein unbeschreiblich schlechtes Gewissen, aber ihr glueckliches Laecheln, weil ich ihr gesagt habe, dass sie leicht wie eine Feder zu tragen ist, dass sie so tough und mutig ist, der Umstand, dass sie nicht genug bekommen konnte und schliesslich an mich gekuschelt eingeschlafen ist, is halt der Beweis, dass sie es auch geniesst. Auch wenn es hart ist ... oder gerade darum. </p>

<p>Hi Iceman,
wirklich netter "Stunt". Carina scheint ja fast alles fuer dich zu machen.
Warum triffst du Carina nicht oefter mal spontan: Ein Anruf, wo sie gerade stecke, du waerst gerade in der Naehe ... Dann "muesste" sie Kleidung und Bauch immer passend haben. Oder "Schick mir mal gerade ein Selfie von dir, ich moechte dich spontan einfach sehen." Dir faellt schon was ein in der Richtung.
Hatte sie wirklich noch zwei weitere Tage gefasstet? Am Abend hat sie ja nach deiner Erzaehlung auch nichts zu Essen bekommen. Fastet sie dann, bis du wieder gehst?</p>

<p>Wie habt ihr die Feiertage verbracht? Ist sie da etwas lockerer oder haelt sie sich auch da ans Training etc.</p>

<p>Im Sommer ist es natuerlich etwas schwieriger, sie mit Kaelte herauszufordern - aber andererseits ist die Zeit, wo Schwimmen im Freien wirklich kuschelig ist und die Abende auch noch gemuetlich warm sind, ja nicht so lange. Vielleicht gibt es da aber auch andere Ideen, sie herauszufordern. Ich koennte mir vorstellen, dass bei ihrer schlanken Figur auch High Heels sehr elegant aussehen. Du koenntest sie z.B. herausfordern, (fast) immer High Heels zu tragen oder so etwas.</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
mir war schon bewusst, dass sie nicht wissen, dass du hier schreibst. Aber Du hast hier immer sehr respektvoll  und auch anonym von allen geschrieben. Jetzt wo sie nicht mehr die Freundin deines Sohnes ist, koenntest Du ihr ja bei passender Gelegenheit davon erzaehlen. (Diesen Eintrag kann ich ja wieder entfernen.)</p>

<p>Du hattest den Teil vom Weihnachtsmarkt, in dem du sie wohl nach Hause gebracht hast, bisher nicht erzaehlt. Andererseits, bei einem echten Verliebsein, aendert das Eingreifen des Vaters nichts, sondern fuehrt eher zu einer Trotzhandlung. Also ich glaube nicht, dass Du Dir da Gedanken machen musst. Und auch Lisa scheint Dir ja keine Schuld zu geben, sonst wuerde sie den Kontakt zu dir ja abbrechen lassen.</p>

<p>Hattest Du Kontakt zu ihr ueber die Feiertage - in Corona-Zeiten ja alles etwas schwierig.</p>

<p>Was ich bei Lisa besonders bemerkenswert finde ist, dass sie nicht nur so verhaeltnismaessig kurze (wenn auch beeindruckende) Stunts macht wie Corinna, sondern stundenlang der Kaelte ausgesetzt ist und wie es sich anhoert auch mehrere Tage hintereinander. 
Wie handhabt sie das im Alltag? Was macht sie ueberhaupt?</p>

<p>Konntest Du Lisas Reaktion beobachten, als er ihr nur das Wasser mitgebracht hat (oder in aehnlichen Situationen). War sie eher veraegert, eher Panik, oder stolz, dass er ihr noch mehr zumutet?</p>

<p>Bleibt alle gesund.</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred,
danke für deine Antwort, du nimmst mir zumindest teilweise mein schlechtes Gewissen zum Grund der Trennung von Lisa zu meinem Sohn, hast schon recht, Lisa gibt mir keine Schuld an der Trennung, sie sucht die Schuld bei sich selbst, was vollkommen unberechtigt ist. Als ich sie an dem unheilvollen Abend, gegen den Willen von meinem Sohn, vom Weihnachtsmarkt nach Hause gebracht habe, ging es Lisa wirklich sehr schlecht, sie war schlimm erkältet und hatte sich noch dazu eine Blasenentzuendung dazugezogen, hatte sie mir gebeichtet, weil ich nicht locker gelassen habe und wissen wollte, wozu sie die vielen Medikamente einnahm. Nachdem sie fast nicht mehr stehen konnte und neben mir auf einer Bank die Kontrolle über sich verlor (was nicht ungewoehnlich fuer sie ist, ich erlebte sie nach Stunden in der Kalte oefter so, kein Wunder, bei so viel nackter Gaensehaut, die ich gern mit meinen Händen etwas zu waermen versuchte, doch  diesmal war sie anders drauf, nicht mehr froehlich, sondern eher leidend) und  mich fragte, ob ich ihr noch eine Schachtel Zigaretten und Schmerzmittel aus der Apotheke besorgen koennte, fasste ich den Entschluss, ihr meinen Mantel ueberzuhaengen und sie nach Hause zu begleiten. Sie willigt sofort ein, was sonst nie geschah. Das loeste den Streit zwischen mir, meinem Sohn und Lisa aus.
Nun kurz zu deinen restlichen Fragen,
ich glaube es ist besser allen Beteiligten erst einmal nichts von dem Forum hier zu erzaehlen.
Ja, ich habe noch Kontakt zu Lisa. Sie hat mir sogar ein Weihnachtsgeschenk vorbei gebracht, fand ich nett von ihr und ich hatte wieder einen Grund Lisa trotz Corona zu umarmen und dabei ihre eiskalte zitternde Gaensehaut zu fühlen.  Es ist wirklich so, dass es Lisa ueber Stunden mit uns in der Kaelte aushaelt, obwohl sie nur einen Minirock und ein leichtes Top traegt. So meinte mal zu mir, dass ihr ihre nackten Beine nichts ausmachen, aber der kalte Wind auf ihrem Oberkoerper schon manchmal hart ist und sie dadurch heftig friert, besonders wenn sie noch nass ist, aber sie sich dran gewöhnt hat. Lisa ist auch im Alltag so gekleidet, ich kenne sie eigentlich nur im Minirock und luftigen Tops, die oft im Nacken und Ruecken gebunden sind oder manchmal auch Bikinioberteile. In der Wohnung sicher kein Problem,obwohl ich sie auch  zu Hause im Winter fast nur in Gaensehaut kenne, da ich ihre Wohnung immer kalt finde. Wenn sie nach Draussen geht zieht sie einfach nichts drüber, meinte einmal zu mir: Friere eh schon den ganzen Tag. Lisa ist freiberuflich tätig, Webdesign und Übersetzungen, arbeitet zu Hause, so kann sie ihrem Kleidungsstil treu bleiben und vor allem muss sie beim Rauchen keine Rücksicht nehmen.
Als mein Sohn Lisa nur ein Wasser mitgebracht hat, war sie eher stolz, weil er ihr ein Kompliment gemacht hat, wie heiss er sie findet. Ich glaube das wünscht sie sich am meisten. Sie zitterte am ganzen Körper, entgegnete mit ihren klappernden Zähnen erschrocken : Sorry, mir war so kalt, da habe ich nicht an die vielen Kalorien gedacht, dabei muss ich doch noch abnehmen. Mein Sohn laechelte zufrieden und pustete in seine Tasse und nahm genuesslich einen Schluck Gluehwein: Ist der heiss, aber wenn du dich aufwaermen moechtest, kannst du natuerlich gern meinen Gluehwein haben, schliesslich bleiben wir noch eine Weile hier. Lisa konnte ihr Glas kaum halten und verschuettete die Haelfte, als sie einen Schluck nehmen wollte: Nein danke,ich  moechte erst zu Hause von dir aufgewaermt werden.</p>

<p>Working past all the spam... How has everyone been going this winter? Seems like this year has been absolutely frigid in the northern hemisphere, can only hope we get the same down south. Prayers for everyone suffering the outages in Texas etc. currently, but can't help getting excited at the idea of all the poor girls who are under-prepared for the weather...</p>

<p>Hi jacq37,
long time not read from you on this board.
Yes, all the spam is annoying.
According to your mail you live in the southern hemisphere having summer right now. This year we have a real winter as it should be. But due to the pandemic situation not many people are around as everything is closed.
But how are you doing? Anything worthwhile reporting from your last winter?</p>

<p>Hallo Martin, </p>

<p>vielen Dank fuer Deinen langen Bericht. Ein wenig "crazy" ist Lisa schon ... und sehr hart im Nehmen.</p>

<p>Mit ihrem Job hat sie natuerlich eine passende Loesung gefunden. So sexy ich zu duenne Kleidung finde, als Vorgesetzter haette ich dennoch so meine Probleme mit einer Mitarbeiterin, die andauernd erkaeltet ist oder mehr.  Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass sie so richtig fit ist im Alltag im Winter.</p>

<p>Dass sie so viel raucht, ist bestimmt da auch keine Hilfe. Ich glaube aber kaum, dass Du sie da mit "Ermahnung" nach dem Motto "rauch doch nicht zu viel" abhaeltst. Vielleicht eher nach dem Motto "andere schaffen das doch auch ihren Hunger unter Kontrolle zu haben, ohne zu rauchen. Dann schaffst Du das auch wohl auch!" Etwas gemein, aber sicherlich wirkungsvoller.</p>

<p>Wie hat sie sich in den letzten Tagen geschlagen, an denen wir mal richtig Winter hatten?</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Vielen Dank für die Antwort, Lisa ist echt hart im Nehmen, sie hat sogar ihr Schwimmtraining bis zum Einbruch der Kältewelle durchgezogen. 
Ja, ihr Job ist ideal für ihren sexy Kleidungsstil, aber hat sicher auch ihre Entwicklung zur starken Raucherin gefördert.
Wie würdest du als Vorgesetzter reagieren, wenn Lisa im Winter nur kurze Miniröcke und knappe Tops zur Arbeit trägt und sie mit zitternder Gänsehaut vor dir steht und mit klappernden Zähnen erklärt: Ich bin es gewöhnt auch im Winter   nur dünne Klamotten zu tragen, fühle mich super, bin nur leicht erkältet.
Du hast Recht, Lisa ist im Winter ständig krank, was sie aber nicht zugibt und sie auch nicht dazu bringt, sich etwas Wärmeres anzuziehen, sie erklärt ihre Hustenanfälle durch das Rauchen. Trotzdem ist Lisa topfit und lässt sich weder ihre starke Erkältung noch ihr sicher vorhandenes Kältegefühl anmerken, nicht einmal in den letzten kalten Tagen.
Marcus und Lisa haben einen Spaziergang gemacht und mich besucht, als es so eisige Temperaturen hatte. Ich traute meinen Augen kaum. Marcus eingepackt, wie am Nordpol und sogar Lisa trug Handschuhe, Mütze, Stiefeln und Hosen, allerdings knallenge Hotpants. Ihren Oberkörper bedeckte nur ein enganliegendes Tanktop, das nicht mal bis zum Bauchnabel reichte und deutlich erkennen liess, dass Lisa nichts unter dem Top trug. Ich betreute meinen kleinen Neffen, wir waren gerade im Aufbruch, um das Winterwetter zum Rodeln zu nutzen. Als ich Lisa begrüsste, wusste ich,dass sie sich unbedingt aufwärmen musste. Sie zitterte am ganzen Körper, ihre Gänsehaut war schon fast bläulich, Lisa hustete schon wieder  und war kaum in der Lage ihre Zigarette zu halten. Ich bat die beiden herein. Marcus meinte: Nein, danke, ihr seit ja schon angezogen.  Dürfen wir mit zum Rodelhang. Ich: Gern, aber lass Lisa sich doch erstmal aufwärmen. Lisa war mit klappernden Zähnen kaum zu verstehen: Nein, nein, auf mich müsst ihr keine Rücksicht nehmen, ich würde nur gern deine Toilette benutzen. Als sie zurück kam und sich ihre Stiefeln anziehen wollte, verlor sie kurz die Kontrolle über ihren Körper. Durch die Wärme in der Wohnung verstärkte sich das Zittern noch. Sie fing sich aber sofort wieder und nahm ihre Stiefeln und den Schlitten mit vor die Tür, zog sie dort an und meinte zu meinem kleinen Neffen: Komm lasst uns starten. Der staunte: Frierst du nicht mit nackigen Beinen? Lisa: Doch, aber ist nicht schlimm für mich. Wir hatten viel Spaß beim rodeln, Lisa war lustig und vergnügt, doch als ich mit Lisa am Hang gemeinsam auf dem Schlitten sass und ich spürte, wie durchgefroren sie war, konnte ich es nicht lassen immer wieder ihre nackte Gänsehaut auf ihren Armen, Bauch und Beinen zu berühren und machte ihr Komplimente: Lisa, du siehst so toll aus, du trainierst so tapfer,  kein Gramm Fett an deinem Körper, und dein Outfit bei diesem Wetter, Marcus ist zu beneiden. Ich habe aber immer so eine Angst um dich, du bist eiskalt, deine Lippen sind blau und bist schon wieder heftig erkältet, bitte lass uns zu mir gehen und wärme dich erstmal auf. Lisa: Danke, du bist so nett zu mir, mir ist wirklich unglaublich kalt, aber gleichzeitig fühle ich mich total gut.

<p>Hallo Martin,
leider ist hier nicht mehr viel interessantes los.</p>

<p>@Iceman - noch da?</p>

<p>Ich weiss nicht, wie ich als Vorgesetzter reagieren wuerde. Jemand der so heraussticht, setzt sich halt jobmaessig selbst unter Druck, weil er fast mehr leisten muss als die anderen, damit kein Gerede aufkommt. Ausserdem darf natuerlich keine Gefahr bestehen, dass andere angesteckt werden etc. </p>

<p>Unabhaengig davon, dass Lisas Kleidung "unpassend" zum Wetter ist, scheint sie sich ja auch noch recht provokant zu zeigen. Ich nehme mal an, dass durch die Kaelte ihre Nippel fast immer hart sind und alles noch besser erkennen lassen. Auch mit BH waere ihre Kleidung ja immernoch sehr sexy und wuerde viel Haut zeigen. Meinst Du, sie zieht sich so an, weil sie daran Spass hat oder eher weil Marcus oder vorher dein Sohn dies so wuenschen. Fuehlt sie sich damit wohl oder eher nicht?</p>

<p>Beim letzten Mal schriebst du, dass sie noch weiter abgenommen hat. Hat sie das weiter fortgesetzt? "Beschwert" sie sich bei Dir auch manchmal ueber den Hunger oder erzaehlt, was sie am Tag oder den Tagen zuvor gegessen hat? Spielt ihr Kreislauf da immer mit?</p>

<p>Wie ist das, wenn du sie unterwegs beobachtest: Bekommt sie noch alles mit und unterhaelt sich mit anderen oder ist sie ab irgendeinem Zeitpunkt so in eine Art Tunnel, wo sie nur noch ihr Frieren und die Beherrschung ihres Koerper im Fokus hat? Wie lange schafft sie es eigentlich noch locker und laessig darzustehen? Verschraenkt sie z.B. ihre Arme?</p>

<p>Wie reagieren eigentlich Unbeteiligte? Wird sie angesprochen?</p>

<p>Es gab ja doch noch ein paar interessante, sprich kuehle Tage, aber auch jetzt wird es abends noch recht schnell frisch. Daher: Gibt es was Neues?</p>

<p>Hat sie sich nach der Rodelpartie denn noch bei dir aufgewaermt?</p>

<p>Schoene Ostertage</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Hier ist leider wirklich nicht mehr viel los, vielleicht gibt es nichts interessantes mehr zu berichten. 
Ich mÂ¶chte mal beginnen deine Fragen zu beantworten. </p>

<p>Ich weiss nicht, wie ich als Vorgesetzter reagieren wuerde. Jemand der so heraussticht, setzt sich halt jobmaessig selbst unter Druck, weil er fast mehr leisten muss als die anderen, damit kein Gerede aufkommt. Ausserdem darf natuerlich keine Gefahr bestehen, dass andere angesteckt werden etc.</p>

<p>Ist sicher fÂ¼r einen Vorgesetzten schwierig angemessen zu reagieren. WÂ¼rdest du auf angemessene Kleidung bestehen oder sie sogar nach Hause schicken, damit sie ihre Erkaeltung auskurieren kann? 
Wuerdest du es geniessen,  eng mit einer Mitarbeiterin zu arbeiten, die ihre Top Figur gern zeigt oder wuerdest du eher abstand halten, damit kein Gerede aufkommt?</p>

<p>Unabhaengig davon, dass Lisas Kleidung "unpassend" zum Wetter ist, scheint sie sich ja auch noch recht provokant zu zeigen. Ich nehme mal an, dass durch die Kaelte ihre Nippel fast immer hart sind und alles noch besser erkennen lassen. Auch mit BH waere ihre Kleidung ja immernoch sehr sexy und wuerde viel Haut zeigen. Meinst Du, sie zieht sich so an, weil sie daran Spass hat oder eher weil Marcus oder vorher dein Sohn dies so wuenschen. Fuehlt sie sich damit wohl oder eher nicht?</p>

<p>Stimmt, sobald Lisa Gaensehaut bekommt sind ihre Nippel sehr deutlich zu erkennen, sie traegt keinen BH mehr, seit mein Sohn ihre Klamotten aussuchen durfte, war mal ein Geschenk an ihn, was er reichlich ausnutzte, erÂ  erwartete seit dieser Zeit auch, dass Lisa oft bis zum ersten Frost barfuss geht. Am Anfang war es ihr eher peinlich ihre harten Nippel zu zeigen, doch mittlerweile hat sie, so glaube ich,Â  sogar Spass daran. Als sie anfing sehr sehr knappe duenne Tops ohne Bh zu tragen, achtete sie darauf direkten Koerperkontakt zu vermeiden, sicher war es ihr peinlich sich fast nackt zu zeigen, das aenderte sich mehr und mehr, sie umarmt jetzt zur Begruessung ihr Gegeueber leidenschaftlich gern. Naja bis zur Coronazeit. Nach der Trennung von meinem Sohn und in der Anfangszeit mit Marcus nahm Lisa etwas zu, war nicht mehr so oft krank und ihr Kleidungsstil war etwas moderater, sie trug zu Minirock und nackten Beinen auch mal eine Jacke oder ein waermeres Shirt. Ich weiss nicht, ob Marcus es von ihr verlangt, doch es dauerte nicht lange und MarcusÂ  trainierte LisaÂ  wieder extrem, sie nahm wieder schnell ab und auch ihr sehr freizÂ¼giger Kleidungsstil war wieder aktuell und das bei jedem Wetter. Sie meinte mal, ihr ganzer Koerper zitternd, zu mir, es waren vielleicht 4 Grad, Lisa noch barfuss und ihre Gaensehaut fast blau, wie kalt sie sich fuehlt: Ich bin es ja gewoehnt zu frieren, aber barfuss ist es echt hart, fÂ¼hle mich so auskÂ¼hlt, aber haette ich nicht gedacht,dass barfuss soviel kaelter ist. Ich nahm sie in den Arm: Es ist so kalt, da kannst du doch nicht mehr barfuss laufen.Â  Komm, lass uns Schuhe fÂ¼r dich holen. Lisa: Danke, Martin, aber ich wuerde Marcus enttaeuschen, er steht darauf mich barfuss zu sehen, als ich heute VormittagÂ  Sandalen anhatte, meinte er, dass er es schade findet, dass ich nun wieder so kalt ist und ich Schuhe tragen muss. </p>

<p>Vielleicht spaeter mehr</p>

<p>Hi all, I could not believe this trend have up to 250+ pages when I wrote about my early cold experience as a teenager. I am hk_princess, the girl who started all this. In my late 20s now. Its been a decade that I could not remembered my password for my original account. There were so many stories, only managed to read a couple, and also so many random spam towards the latter pages. Used google translate on some of the recent sharings too.</p>

<p>It was good to read through some of the stories and experiences. My friends nicknamed me Snowy these days, so i figured to use this name for here too. I do have some stories to share. Even since my sharing a decade ago, I had been wearing a lot more during the winter since I broke up with my first bf. But a couple of years ago, I faced quarter-life crisis that changed me. I am not going to go in details and go straight into a story.</p>

<p>A guy whom I was fond of was hosting a beach party, and challenged girls to wear bikini for the party as thats what girls wear at the beach right? except it was in Jan, in the middle of winter. I was in Scotland at the time and it had been snowing too. I saw it as an opportunity to get to know this guy so I decided to wear bikini for the party. A couple of girls were picking me up at an location about 5mins walk from my house. I wore my bikini, with a mini boot so my feet would not freeze. My whole body was already full of goosbumps and my hand were pretty cold even at home. The moment I opened the door, the icy breeze blowed onto my almost naked body and I shivered instantly. I really wanted to go back and changed but also dont want the girls to have to wait for me. When I got to the waiting area, shivering a lot already in those 5mins, one of the girls messaged me and said they were running 15mins late. I saw a bench so I sat there and wait. As each minute went by, my shivering were stronger and stronger. I could see cars driving pass and people were watching me. My mind were thinking, the beach was probably going to be colder and windier, I hoped my body would survive and there was nothing much I could do now except to brave it out. The 15mins late took eternity. The girls were shocked to see I was in a bikini, and said I was crazy. Even in the heated car, I had goosebumps and shivered in wave. We got to the beach around 6pm. and I already attracted lots of attention for being the only one in a bikini. I did not know how I was surviving and the girls said they would not be leaving early because I was too stupid to wear something warmer. I told them I would not leave early. I did not know how I survived but my mindset was that I did not bring anything warm to wear so I had to tough it out. The goosebumps on my skins were so intense that it hurted, and I was shivering and shaking way too much and drawing lots of attention from everyone.</p>

<p>Around 7pm, the host (now my fiance) came to me and asked if I was cold. That was a silly question to ask as it was obvious that I was freezing. But I tried to hold my shiver for a couple for seconds so I could speak. I told him that for a beach party, wearing bikini was normal, with a smile and chattering teeth. He asked if I wanted to take a walk with him along the beach which I accepted. He said he had a spare jacket in his car which I refused. I was shivering so much that it was difficult to walk but I tried my best to keep up. He noticed I was falling behind and slowed down his pace. It took us some time to reach the other side of a beach and he asked if we should sit down and had a rest. Sitting down did not help at all, and my shivering was getting more violent and my chattering teeth was loud. He said he admired that I did not even fold my arms or rub my hands/arms/thighs etc or ask for a jacket to try and get some warmth, and instead trying to act normal except the uncontrollable shivering and chattering teeth. I told him its not like rubbing my arms would make me any warmer, and I chose this outfit so I would not ask anyone for additional clothing to warm up.</p>

<p>After some chats and getting to know each other, we walked back to the other side of the beach where the party was held. I could hardly walk at that point that I had to put my arm onto his arm for some support to make it back. It was a very slow walk. At that point, I felt I possibly had mild hypothermia but I was not going to let people say that I could not handle the cold and still wore a bikini, so my mind kept telling me to keep pushing and that I could get through the evening. By about 9pm, one of my best friends noticed I probably could not last much longer, and suggested to the other girls it was late and we should head home. But the other girls ignored her and said it was still early. Which was true as it was not late at all, but for me in a bikini in subzero temperature with icy breeze, it was a very long time. My friend suggested calling a taxi and left before I ended up at hospital. But I told her I was fine, which obviously I was not. Around 10pm, the host thanked people for coming to his party and ended the party. I was relieved that I managed to survive in a bikini for such a long time.</p>

<p>He then came to me and said if I was not too tired, he wanted to bring me to a place special to him. I told him I could go with him. He took me to his car, that was the warmest I felt all night. He drove up a mountain and when he stopped, he noticed I was still shivering a lot despite the car much warmer than out at the beach for 4 hours. he said if I was still cold, we could stay in the car. I told him I was fine, and we took a walk on the mountain. Once the door opened, I could feel it was even colder and windier than at the beach. My body could not warm up at all and I really did not know how much longer my body could cope.</p>

<p>I did not realise this post was getting very long. I hope I did not bore anyone, and will continue part 2 if people want me to share me. I am just fascinated that my original sharing a decade ago leading to so much more stories and sharings over the years.</p>

<p>Peace, and stay safe during COVID.</p>

<p>Snowy. </p>

<p>Hi snowy,
Schoen, dass du dich meldest. Natuerlich bin ich an deiner Story interessiert. Bitte schreibe uns, wie es weiter ging. Leider kann ich nur in deutsch schreiben. Ich schreibe hier, weil mein Sohn seine Freundin Lisa kennengelernt hat, die auch im Winter nur kurze Miniroecke und knappe Tops traegt, dabei extrem friert, davon oft krank wird und trotzdem stundenlang in der Kaelte ausharrt. Mich faszinieren Frauen, wie du und Lisa , die sich so freizuegig fuer ihre Freunde  kleiden. Bist du auch staendig erkaeltet? Wie reagieren die Mitmenschen? Musst du dich ueberwinden nur im Bikini vor die Tuer zu treten, wenn du weisst, dass du gleich unglaublich frieren wirst?</p>

<p>Bleib gesund.
Martin </p>

<p>Hey Martin, german is fine, I can use google translate. I have actually read through most of your post about Lisa before my sharing a few days ago. I don't think I am as brave and as committed as Lisa. To answer some of your questions, I do not constantly feel cold, well maybe for winter, but I definitely also take note of my health, for example, I don't think I will go outside in a bikini in a blizzard storm for many hours. I can stay outside easy between 0-10C, or even -10C for a whole day in just a thin short sleeve t-shirt, and mini skirt, as long as I do not get wet, and the day not too windy. I don't mind subzero temperature as long as not raining/snowing or windy. I still shiver, very cold to the touch, and have goosebumps. But if I am occupied with tasks, those just generally fall off my mind even though I would still be very cold. But strong wind in subzero temperature are definitely very tough for me to handle, especially if outside for a long time (eg, the winter bikini beach party).</p>

<p>As to your other question, strangers always have a shock face haha. Some may even start a conversation with me. Most of my friends kindof get used to it, and thus gave me nickname Snowy. I always try and encourage girls to give it a try, some would have mini skirt/dress with bare legs but with a jacket to keep upper body warm.</p>

<p>I will probably share part 2 of that evening, and some other stories over the past few years later.</p>

<p>Snowy :)</p>

<p>Hello, hk snowy, first of all I am deeply thankful for your first post which created so so many stories over the past decade! I myself have a cold fetish and have explored it deeply with multiple sexual partners over the past few years and I even produce cold fetish material with those who are wishing to indulge in such an endeavor. Please do continue your story and do you perhaps have a story which involves you being cold and wet as well? Also, do you perhaps anything that you would like to ask me or anyone from the other side of the fetish, male side in this case.</p>

<p>Kind regards!</p>

<p>hello snowy and other people!</p>

<p>I discovered this thread years ago, occasionally checking for new messages but never writing any myself.</p>

<p>I'm amazed how tough you are. I love how he jokingly suggested the bikini thing and you just took the challenge and went with it. Spending half an hour or so at the beach in winter just wearing a bikini would have already been a really long time, but a whole evening is just insane.
I'd be thrilled to hear a part 2 and more stories about what you've experienced the past few years. Feel free to spare no details!</p>

<p>Stay safe everyone!</p>

<p>Hi dreamproducer,</p>

<p>yes, I do have stories that I was both cold and wet, actually happened many times. Thats why I mentioned that being windy or wet are so much harder to stay outside in the cold for a long time. It was from my own experience on days of rain/snow and windy.</p>

<p>Hi mikemikemikemike,</p>

<p>yes, I will definitely continue with part 2 of that evening soon, as well as some of my other experiences with being in extreme cold past couple of years. Just need to find time to write!</p>

<p>catch up again soon.</p>

<p>Hi to everyone on this forum, these links are a few trailers and a sample of the shivering videos I love creating, as you will see they offer real extreme shivering since they were filmed in extremely cold environments as well, my filming ranges from 20 minutes to an hour in 0 or minus temperatures, The prices for them are absurdly low compared to some other producers and thus I hope some of you will take an interest in them :D</p>

<p>Kind regards!</p>

<p>Hi Snowy,
Sicher bist du genau so mutig, wie Lisa. Einen ganzen Abend nur  im Bikini am Strand im Winter zu verbringen ist eine erstaunliche Herausforderungen. Du warst bestimmt das Highlight des Abends. Dir war sicher unglaublich kalt und hast nicht an deine Gesundheit gedacht, sondern nur an deine neue Bekanntschaft und Liebe. Bin schon gespannt, wie dein jetztiger Verlobter mit dir den Rest der Nacht verbracht hat. Er war bestimmt stolz so eine coole Frau im Arm zu halten.  Sicher war es für dich noch schwieriger in der Kaelte auszuhalten. Hast du seine Jacke angezogen?
Bist du oft krank? Lisa ist im Winter oft sehr krank, aber trotzdem zeigt sie weiter viel von ihrer Gaensehaut. Sie behauptet dann ihr starker Husten kommt vom Rauchen. 
Du bist sehr abgehaertet, bei -10 Grad Celsius noch im Minirock und duennem kurzen T-Shirt unterwegs zu sein. Ich kenne die Herausforderung von Lisa bei diesen Temperaturen laengere Zeit drassen   auszuhalten. Bist du auch so unterwegs, wenn dein Verlobter nicht dabei ist? Lisa ist auch ohne Marcus fast immer nur noch mit Minirock und knappen Top draussen zu sehen. Erstaunlich, dass ihr die Reaktion eures Koerpers ignorieren koennt und euch so im Griff habt weiter an Gespraechen und Aktivitaeten teilzunehmen. Freunde und Bekannte kennen Lisa nur leicht bekleidet im Winter und doch glaube ich, dass auch sie euch bewundern, jedenfalls geht es mir so. Ich begegne ihr ganz normal, wenn ich Lisa treffe und sie kaum zu verstehen ist, weil ihre Zähne so sehr klappern und wenn sie mich mit ihrem zitternden Körper zur Begruessng  fest umarmt, geniesse ich es regelrecht ihre eisige Gaensehaut zu fuehlen und sage ihr: Lisa  du bist ja eiskalt, aber siehst  so heiss aus.
Snowy, wie begruesst du Bekannte und Freunde? Umarmst du sie gern? Oder möchtest du nicht, dass sie fuehlen und spueren, wie kalt du wirklich bist? Wie reagierst du auf die Frage, ob dir kalt ist?
Toll,dass du andere Maedchen ermutigst etwas Haut zu zeigen. Mit Jacke ist es vielleicht noch gut ertraeglich. Lisa meinte einmal zu mir, dass Marcus immer oefter ihre Klamotten aussucht, Minirock und nackte Beine machen ihr nicht viel aus, aber Marcus seine neuen Vorlieben Lisa nur ein Bikini-Oberteil zum Minirock auszusuchen und sie dazu noch bis etwa 5 Grad Celsius barfuss laufen zu lassen ist eine enorme Herausforderung. Ich habe die Zwei mal so getroffen, Marcus musste kurz  ins Buero, ich durfte Lisa im Arm in einen nahegelegenen Park begleiten, wo wir auf Marcus warten sollten. Lisa zitterte am ganzen Koerper, konnte kaum laufen, hustete immer wieder, schaffte es nicht ihre Zigarette in ihrer zitternden Hand zu halten. Ich hob sie auf, dabei wurde mir bewusst, wie sehr  Lisa im kalten Wind frieren musste, praktisch trug sie nichts auf ihrer Gaensehaut, Lisa konnte kaum stehen, wir setzten uns auf eine Bank. Ich fragte sie: Bist du Okay? Lisa strich kurz ueber ihre wild zitternden Oberschenkel, um sie in den Griff zu bekommen, doch ihr gesamter Körper zitterte unglaublich, dazu wurde ihr Husten immer schlimmer und durch ihre klappernden  Zähne war Lisa kaum zu verstehen: Oh Gott, ist mir kalt, der eisige Wind und der kalte Boden haben mich so ausgekühlt, wir sind schon seit vormittags draussen. Ich: Du bist verrueckt. Warum ziehst du bei diesen Temperaturen nicht wenigstens ein Shirt und Schuhe an? Lisa: Das hatte ich gestern an, als ich heute frueh Marcus gefragt habe, wie er mich ausfuehren moechte, meinte er, dass er mich am liebsten in einer geilen Gaensehaut ausführt, da habe ich mich für das Bikinioberteil entschieden  und als wir los wollten meinte er noch, dass zum Bikini keine Schuhe passen. Ich zündete ihr eine neue Zigarette an, spuerte, dass sie an ihre Grenzen kommt: Darf ich dir meine Jacke umhaengen? Lisa : Danke, Martin, du bist so lieb zu mir, aber Marcus waere enttaeuscht, wenn er mich in deiner Jacke sieht. Ich rueckte noch naeher an Lisa heran und fand es ehrlich gesagt faszinierend Lisa im Arm zu halten und ihr immer wieder ueber ihren nackten Ruecken zu streichen. Ich: Lisa du bist schon so ausgekuehlt, bitte zieh sie wenigstens mal kurz drueber, du bist doch schon krank. Lisa setzte sich auf meinen Schoss, umklammerte mich und fluesterte mir ins Ohr: Stimmt, bin echt durchgefroren und erkältet, aber du magst doch auch meine nackte Gaensehaut, da muss deine heisse Hand zum Waermen reichen. Ohne eine Antwort abzuwarten, sprang sie auf und meinte: Komm, zünde mir noch eine Zigarette an und lass uns noch eine Runde hier im Park gehen. Hier trafen wir auf Marcus. Ich sagte ihm, dass er auf Lisa besser Acht geben muss und Lisa bei diesen Temperaturen wenigstens ein Shirt tragen sollte. Er musterte Lisa, gab ihr einen Kuss und nahm sie in den Arm und meinte: Ich finde, solange es Lisa nicht zu kalt ist, muss sie ihren Koerper nicht unter einem Shirt verstecken und fragte sie: Ist dir zu kalt oder koennen wir  noch in die City.  Lisa zitterte extrem, hustete und antwortete mit klappernden Zaehnen : Nein, Schatz wir müssen noch nicht nach Hause, so kalt ist mir noch lange nicht, bei dir fühle ich mich immer heiss.</p>

<p>LG Martin </p>

<p>avatar the last airbender. The fire nation has almost destroyed the Earth Kingdom, and the Water Tribe is much smaller. The Air Nomads were wiped out 100 years ago, and Aang is the last airbender. Should he not defeat the fire lord, the Fire Nation will win the war and dominate if not wipe out the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom.</p>

<p>It seems off topic but I've heard stories on the Internet of white guys in the Midwest of the US, in rural republican farms, wearing nothing but T shirts and shorts in freezing cold weather while farming or working on their buffalo ranch or cow ranch, they must've understood the Air Nomads' way of life!</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
was gibt es Neues von Lisa zu berichten? Es ist zwar zurzeit Sommer, aber es gab doch einige Tage, die recht frisch und verregnet waren - je nach Gegend.
Stellt Martin im Sommer noch andere Herausforderungen an Lisa ausser duenner Kleidung? Vermutlich ist ihm Lisas strenge Diaet jetzt besonders wichtig, weil auch andere Maedchen leichter bekleidet unterwegs sind. Aber vielleicht ist ihm ja noch etwas anderes eingefallen, um Lisas Durchhaltevermoegen zu testen.</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Es gibt eigentlich nicht viel neues zu berichten, wie ich schon mal geschrieben habe ist mein kleiner Neffe Paul in Lisa vernarrt und zu meiner Freude Lisa in ihn. Wenn ich Paul betreue und er bei mir ist bettelt er, dass ich Lisa bitte, mit ihm zu spielen. Die Gelegenheit habe ich natürlich gern genutzt, um Lisa zu treffen. Du hast Recht, es gab diesen Sommer viele kühlere Tage und Abende, doch Lisa kleidet sich freizügig wie immer, kann sie sich wirklich leisten, bei ihrer braungebrannten Superfigur, meist ein winziger Rock, den sie ganz tief tragen muss, um ihren Po zu bedecken. Dadurch sind ihre Hüftknochen besonders gut zu sehen. Dazu wirklich minimalistische Bandeautops oder Neckholdertops in der Art von Bikinioberteilen.  Obwohl jetzt Sommer ist habe ich Lisa oft von Kopf bis Fuß in Gänsehaut und vorallem Abends auch zitternd erlebt. Kein Wunder, Lisa ist nach meiner Meinung noch schlanker geworden und ausserdem ist sie für Marcus fast nur noch barfuss unterwegs. Zum Glück konnte ich die Lisa und Marcus jetzt wieder Abends ins Restaurant einladen, wir haben natürlich immer im Freien gesessen. Lisa musste sich meist mit einem Espresso und Wasser begnügen. Marcus meinte einmal zu einer sehr kurvigen Kellnerin: Meine Frau arbeitet an ihrer Bikinifigur, da muss abends auch mal eine Zigarette reichen. Fand die Kellnerin nicht so lustig. Ein anderes mal war es recht kühl, alle trugen Jacken und Hosen, nur Lisa natürlich nicht, Lisa überkam ein heftiger Schauer als der noch sehr junge Kellner an unserem Tisch stand, er sprach sie auf ihre Gänsehaut und ihre fehlende Jacke an und bot uns einen Tisch im Restaurant an. Marcus lehnte dankend ab: Meine Frau trägt lieber Gänsehaut statt einer Jacke. Der Kellner brachte unsere Getränke, konnte seine Blicke nicht von Lisa lassen und verschüttete am späten Abend mein Bier über den Tisch, welches Lisa über ihren weissen Minirock und ihre Oberschenkel nach unten lief. Der Kellner nahm ein Tuch, starrte auf ihren Minirock und fragte Lisa: Darf ich? Lisa konnte ihr Zittern und Zähneklappern schon lange nicht mehr unterdrücken rutschte auf dem Stuhl nach vorn: Du hast das Bier verschüttet, also versuche den Schaden auch zu beheben. Er bemühte sich Lisa ihren Minirock trocken zu tupfen. Nach kurzer Zeit meinte Lisa: Der Rock trocknet schon wieder, ist eh nicht viel Stoff, aber auf meinen Beinen ist alles voll Bier. Der Kellner war verunsichert. Marcus lachte: Na los, befreie sie schon der klebrigen Brühe, zum Glück trägt meine Frau auch an den Beinen nichts als nackte Gänsehaut. Lisa stand auf. Mit zitternder Hand hielt sie ihren Minirock etwas höher. Der junge Kellner wurde noch roter im Gesicht, ging in die Hocke, tupfte und rieb Lisa ihre zitternden braungebrannten gänsehautbedeckten Beine trocken.
Marcus trainiert Lisa weiter, manchmal bis zur Erschöpfung. Wir haben Lisa und  Marcus  mal beim Schwimmtraining  am See besucht, Marcus hatte mich gebeten Pizza und Zigaretten mitzubringen. Lisa war echt erschöpft, drückte ihre Zigarette aus und meinte freudig zu Marcus: Hab ich mir heute ein Stück Pizza verdient? Marcus strich Lisa von hinten über ihre Hüfte: Pizza? Ist bestimmt nicht gut für deine Figur. Für dich hat Martin Zigaretten besorgt. Aber gut, glaub schon, dass du dir heute ein Stück verdient hast. Paul sagte sofort: Ich gebe dir ein Stück ab. Lisa: Danke Paul, habe ich nur so gesagt, ich rauche lieber noch eine Zigarette. Ich bot ihr sofort eine an. Lisa rauchte nicht nur eine Zigarette, sondern sofort wieder und wieder die nächste.  Ihre Hustenanfälle haben sich zwar insgesamt jetzt im Sommer gebessert, aber nun waren sie wieder heftig. Trotzdem musste mich Lisa in ihrem knappen Bikini nur ansehen und ich zündete ihr gern die nächste Zigarette an, bevor mich mein schlechtes Gewissen überkam. Ich genieße diese Berührungen einfach zu sehr,  mittlerweile war es schon ziemlich abgekühlt, wenn sie zitternd mit ihrer nassen Gänsehaut neben mir sitzt, sie sich mit klappernden Zähnen mit mir unterhält und ich sie fest in meinen Armen halten darf.</p>

<p>Hello, there !</p>

<p>The Big C und die Waerme des Sommers waren leider keine guten Vorraussetzungen, um die Dinge zu erleben, die wir hier im Forum so gerne erleben (und berichten). Aber nachdem ich mich noch im Urlaub befinde und gerade einige wunderschoene und erfrischende Tage in einem Alpen-Chalet verbracht habe und meine Eisprinzessin wieder einen ihrer Stunts fuer mich hingelegt hat, habe ich beschlossen, nicht egoistisch zu sein und dieses Erlebnis zu teilen.  </p>

<p>Eigentlich war der Trip als Verwoehnprogramm fuer meine Liebste geplant und ich hatte keine grossen Erwartungen daran. Die ganze Pandemiekacke hat in meinem Business auch mehr Druck erzeugt, aber Carina war halt noch mehr damit konfrontiert und das hat ihrem empfindsamen Seelchen nicht gut getan. Da ich das - speziell weil nach vielen Diskussionen mit ihr mittlerweile geimpft - zudem eher locker sehe, aber deutlich aelter bin als sie und im Unterschied zu meiner Hungerkuenstlerin uebergewichtsbedingt vielleicht schon risikobehaftet, hat sie sich auch um mich dauernd Sorgen gemacht, was suess, aber manchmal nervig war. Da ich sie wirklich liebe, ist mir jedenfalls nicht entgangen, dass sie nicht gut drauf ist und ich habe daher auf ueber 1500 m ein Chalet mit tollem Ausblick und einem (gut fuer sie, schlecht fuer mich) beheizten Aussenpool gebucht, das total einsam gelegen war. Nur fuer uns beide.</p>

<p>Sie hat es wirklich gebraucht: Ich bin - wie schon bekannt - verrueckt nach total mageren Maedels und es turnt mich extrem an, wenn sie fastet und hart trainiert fuer mich. Leider ist aber ersteres meiner Meinung nach im Moment aber ausser Kontrolle geraten und sie hungert so extrem, dass ich die Notbremse ziehen wollte. Hab es zwar - wenn wir zusammen waren - geschafft, dass sie nicht weiter Gewicht verliert, aber ich will sie nicht staendig 'fuettern' muessen und vor allem nicht, dass sie noch abhaengiger von mir wird, wobei sie ohnedies schon sehr klammert.
Ich finde es zwar sexy, wenn sie am Abend ploetzlich vor meiner Tuer steht, durchnaesst, durchgefroren und erschoepft (das waer vielleicht doch einen Post wert) weil sie die weite Strecke im Regen mit ihrem rostigen Drahtesel von ihrer Bude zu mir gefahren ist, weil sie Sehnsucht hatte und bei mir sein wollte, aber … na ja, da koennte sie gleich einziehen.</p>

<p>Wir sind jedenfalls fuer einige Tage da rauf. Es war nieselig und mit etwa 2 Grad doch extrem kalt. Trotz oder gerade deshalb ist der Pool so warm gewesen, dass mein zarte Elfe ohne Zittern und Zaehneklappern schwimmen konnte. Das Wasser hatte mindestens 35 Grad und da wir alleine waren, konnte sie auch auf nen Bikini verzichten.  Da sie immer unter Wasser war und ich bei der Kaelte auch nicht am Poolrand stehen wollte, hab ich allerdings nix gehabt davon. Der Trip war - wie gesagt - ja auch als Verwoehnprogramm fuer meine zarte Schneeelfe gedacht und es war daher auch logisch, dass wir ansonsten vor dem offenen Kamin unter einer Decke gekuschelt haben und Carina meist mit einem meiner, fuer sie viel zu großen, Pullover und auch sonst jeder Menge Klamotten herum gelaufen ist.  Selbst in der Nacht, hatte sie was an.</p>

<p>Auch wenn ihr das Kuscheln gut getan hat, musste ich dann doch einen Gang hochschalten und ich hab also durch den dicken Pulli immer wieder versucht, sie zaertlich zu streicheln, habe aber immer dann gestoppt, wenn sie begonnen hat, heiss zu werden.
Man(n) sagt zwar immer, dass fuer Maedels Kuscheln genauso so schoen ist wie Sex, aber fuer meine temperamentvolle Carina, schien das nicht zu gelten. Gerade deshalb habe ich - egal wie heiss ich auf sie war - das Spiel die ganze Zeit weiter gespielt und gemerkt, wie sie mit jeden Tag verzweifelter wurde.</p>

<p>An unserem letzten Tag hat sie offenbar - um sicher zu gehen - daher klarerweise den Spiess umgedreht.
Mir war schon den ganzen Tag ueber aufgefallen, dass sie wieder keinen Bissen gegessen und  den ganzen Tag im Gym des Chalets trainiert hatte. Als sie am Abend im Wohnzimmer aufgetaucht ist - nur mit einem dicken Wollpullover bekleidet, der ihr bis ueber die Knie reichte - wirkte sie zwar unendlich muede und ausgepowert, aber das Klitzern in ihren Augen war so voller Leidenschaft, Sehnsucht und Hunger, dass mir klar war, was sie wollte. Ihre langen, schlanken, perfekt definierten Beine waren per se schon ein wundervoller Anblick. &lt; Nimm, deine Jacke. Ich will schwimmen. > Dieser leichte italienische Akzent klingt immer so extrem sexy. </p>

<p>Als ich draussen war, war sie bereits im Wasser, das ob der Kaelte in der Luft gedampft hat. Obwohl der Pool und die Umgebung erleuchtet waren, war nicht viel zu sehen. Ich setzte mich auf einen der hoelzenen Sonnenliegen und wartete. Da sie keinen Bademantel und kein Handtuch mitgenommen hat, dachte ich, sie wuerde gleich in die Huette laufen und freute mich darauf, sie nackt aus dem Wasser kommen zu sehen. Der Wind war eiskalt und es hatte sicher unter 0 Grad. Lang brauchte ich nicht zu erwarten und Carina stieg langsam Treppe fuer Treppe aus dem Pool. Der kalte Wind zauberte sofort eine Gaensehaut auf ihren dampfenden Koerper und ich bemerkte wie ihr ein Schauer ueber den Koerper gelaufen ist und sie versuchte, das Zittern zu unterdruecken.</p>

<p>Sie war ein traumhaft schoener Anblick, auch wenn ich sie noch nie so zart und zerbrechlich gesehen habe. Als sie langsam mit zittrigen Knien auf mich zugeschlendert ist, wie eine ausgehungerte Raubkatze, wollte ich meine Jacke auszuziehen, um sie zu waermen.  Doch sie  schuettelte nur ihren Kopf, dass das Wasser von ihren, lockigen Haaren spritze und streckte sich vollkommen nackt auf der Holzliege neben mir aus. Als sie ihre schoenen, schlanken Arme hob, war es, als wuerde mein Blut kochen. Sie war so schoen, so wunderschoen, aber es war auch dadurch deutlich sichtbar, wie extrem duenn und ausgehungert dieses Maedchen war. Zwei Windstoesse die uber ihren eingesunkenen Bauch fegten genuegten und sie begann unkontrollierbar zu zittern.  Sie hatte wirklich kein Fett mehr und da war jeder Muskel, der gezittert hat. Ich wollte sie wieder mit meiner Jacke zudecken, damit sie nicht so extrem frieren wuerde, aber sie drehte mir nur den Kopf zu und mit einem schuechternen Laecheln ihrer zitternenden, blauen Lippen und ihren klappernden, schneeweissen Zaehnen, meinte sie leise, dass ich sie nur streicheln duerfte. &lt; Deine Hand ist das einzige, was mich waermen wird. > Ich hab sie ganz zaertlich gestreichelt und ich weiss nicht, ob es der eisige Wind, der Umstand, dass meine Haende auch schon abgekuehlt waren oder die Leidenschaft war: Sie zitterte extrem heftig, ihre Haut war blau marmoriert, eiskalt und sie hatte die extremste Gaensehaut, die ich jemals gespuert habe. Mit jeder Beruehrung auf ihrem kleinen, festen Bruesten, dem harten, angespannten Bauch, ihren zittrigen Oberschenkeln und zwischen ihren Beinen wurde dieses Zittern heftiger und wilder. Ich hab trotzdem versucht, auch wenn ich selber vor dem explotieren war, sie nicht zu rasch kommen zu lassen. &lt; Ich kann nicht mehr. Bitte ! > Sie sprang auf, sass ploetzlich auf mir drauf und versuchte mit ihren zarten, eiskalten und wie im Schuettelfrost zitternden Finger, den Reisverschluss meiner Jean aufzuziehen. </p>

<p>Wir waren so wild, dass die Sonnenliege unter mir zusammengekracht ist. Aber mir war das egal. Sie hat so aufgeschrien, dass ich erst Angst hatte, ich haette ihr wehgetan. Doch das Laecheln in ihrem Gesicht und wie schutzsuchend dieses frierende, zarte Wesen nun unter meinen Pullover gekrochen ist,  hat mir gezeigt, dass alles gut war. 
Sie war so erschoepft, dass sie unter zwei Decken, an mich gekuschelt, sofort eingeschlafen ist.  Sie hat trotzdem erst nach ueber 2 Stunden langsam zu zittern aufgehoert. Ich habe kein Auge zubekommen in der Nacht. ;-)</p>

<p>Hallo Iceman,
vor lauter Spam uebersieht man ja fast die richtigen Nachrichten. Vielen Dank fuer deinen Bericht. Und selbstredend interessieren auch Einzelheiten zu Carinas Fahrradtouren. Jetzt beginnt ja wieder die interessante und fuer die Elfen herausfordernde Zeit.</p>

<p>Etwas verstehe ich aber nicht ganz in eurem Spiel. Du beeichnest es ja selbst als eine Art SM-Beziehung und dies wuerde ja bedeuten, dass sich der "Sub" unterwerfen, also leiden will um den "Master" zu erfreuen.</p>

<p>Dann muesste doch ein "Verwoehnprogramm" zur Entschaedigung doch eher so aussehen, dass du dich den ganzen Tag um Carina "kuemmerst" in dem Sinne, dass du sie zu immer weiteren Hoechstleistungen anstachelst, ihren Mut, Tapferkeit, Durchhaltewillen, ... lobst und sie anschliessend "verwoehnst". Hattet ihr schon einmal eine solche Situation?</p>

<p>Im Gegensatz zu Lisa sind es ja bei Carina eher einzelne "Stunts", wenn ich das so richtig verfolge. Ebenso faellt mir auf, dass Carina und du eure Kaeltespiele eher zu zweit auslebt. Bei Lisa scheint es eher so zu sein, dass es haeufig oeffentlich ist, sie sich in Situationen bringt, in denen ein Rueckzieher eher peinlich waere. Damit meine ich z.B. leicht bekleidet auf eine Party gehen und dann nachher doch etwas (vielleicht Unpassendes) anzuziehen oder mit zum Essen zu gehen, nichts bestellen und dann, wenn das Essen kommt, der eigene Hunger immer beissender wird, doch etwas zu nehmen (von anderen Tellern).</p>

<p>Vielleicht sind das aber auch nur zufaellig die Ereignisse, von denen Du hier berichtest.</p>

<p>@Martin: Hast Du Lisa diesbezueglich schon mal genauer beobachtet oder hat sie sich dir gegenueber schon mal geaeussert?</p>

<p>Hi, Ferfred.
Ja, es is so intermediate. Sie ist schone eine 'Sub', aber ich kein richtiger 'Master'.
Bsp.: Obwohl ich selber ein schwerer Junge bin, mag ich extrem magere Maedels die nur Haut, Knochen und a bissel Muskeln haben. Sie weiss das, will mir unbedingt gefallen und trainiert und hungert deshalb. Das Endresultat gefaellt mir natuerlich extrem. Sie ist perfekt. Dass sie fuer mich aber koerperlich leidet (und das tut sie), sehe ich ambivalent. Einerseits taugt mir auch das (darum die Bezeichnung SM), andererseits habe ich ein schlechtes Gewissen, weil ich eigentlich will, dass es ihr gut geht und ich es auch als meine Aufgabe sehe, sie zu beschuetzen (siehe unten)
Es ist auch tatsaechlich so, dass Carina diese Kaeltespiele auch nur macht, weil mir das gefaellt und sie den Umstand, dass ich dann besonders scharf auf sie bin und das ganze in besonders leidenschaftlichem Sex muendet, als Belohnung fuer ihre Leidensfaehigkeit empfindet. Und natuerlich haben wir auch oft 'normal' Sex ohne Kaeltevorspiel. 
Was deine andere Frage betrifft: Doch, sie macht das auch oeffentlich. Aber auch nur fuer mich. Wenn sie alleine unterwegs ist, dann hat sie viel an, weil sie eigentlich sehr leicht friert. Hab eh einge Sachen dazu gepostet. Rueckzieher macht sie aber nie. Also, sie wuerde nie von einem anderen Teller was essen, egal wie hungrig sie ist. Im Gegenteil … sie kocht zB sogar fuer mich, obwohl sie tagelang fastet und trainiert und extremen Hiunger hat. Und wenn sie friert, um mich zu verfuehren, dann muss ich aufpassen, dass sie nicht uebertreibt. Ich glaub, das hab ich eh auch mal gepostet. Aber sie waer mal sogar um Haaresbreite abgesoffen und ich muss immer aufpassen, dass sie nicht komplett auskuehlt, gerade weil sie so extrem zart und manchmal auch ausgehungert ist. Find auch Lisas Schwimmtraining im See darum durchaus gefährlich. Lisa duerfte generell noch extremer sein, wie Carina. Aber eben darum, weil - ausser Martin - niemand sich Gedanken macht. Darum war Martin ja auch der Grund, warum ich hier zu posten begonnen habe. Er ist genauso wie ich hin und her gerissen zwischen sich Sorgen um das Maedel machen und fasziniert sein. Das Verwöhnprogramm war tatsaechlich als solches gemeint … ohne Hintergedanken (zumindest fast ohne) und sie hat sich dann eben revanchiert. </p>

<p>Wie versprochen, die Geschichte von unserem spontanen Treffen, die vielleicht nicht so spektakulaer wie Carinas sonstige Stunts war, meiner zarten Schneeelfe aber trotzdem eine maechtige Gaensehaut ueber ihren Traumbody gejagt und die Muskeln meiner durchtrainierten Schoenheit  ordentlich zum Zittern gebracht hat. Da sich unsere Lebensrhythmen berufsbedingt deutlich unterscheiden und der Alltag nur zu oft die Leidenschaft killt, habe ich es bisher wie der Teufel das Weihwasser vermieden, dass sie bei mir einzieht. Gerade wenn ich zuhause den Buerokram meiner Firma erledigen will, kann ich weder ihre Kuschelattacken gebrauchen, noch den Umstand, dass sie manchmal gerade dann reden will, wenn ich mich konzentrieren muss oder einfach nur Ruhe moechte. Umgekehrt weiss ich schon, dass ihr Mitteilungsbeduerfniss ihrer Unsicherheit geschuldet ist. Overthinking und Need for Reassurance heisst das glaub ich. Sie ist wunderschoen und sexy und leidenschaftlich und alles was man(n) sich so wuenscht. Der Preis dafuer ist, dass sie mit dem Alleinesein ueberhaupt nicht klar kommt und fast zur Selbstzerstoerung neigt, wenn ich nicht dauernd auf sie acht gebe. Hab's eh schon oefter geschrieben, dass sie aehnlich wie Martins Lisa mangelnde Aufmerksamkeit oder eine (vermeintlich drohende) Trennung mit extrem hartem Training, hungern oder anderen Maso-Aktionen beantwortet. Da hat sie echt einen Vogel. Andererseits ist sie ansonsten ja happy und das Ergebnis ihrer Selbstquaelerei ist halt diese Megafigur, auf die ich und wahrscheinlich 90% der Heteromaenner abfahren.
Vor etlichen Wochen war mal wieder so eine Phase. Ich hab mit meiner Firma ein grosses Werbe-Projekt abgeschlossen gehabt, durch welches ich schon mal keine Zeit fuer sie hatte. Da sie zur selben Zeit auch extrem viel gearbeitet hat und mir geschrieben hat, dass sie die Zeit fuers Trainieren im Gym nutzen wollte, dachte ich, dass es eh okay is. Sie hat mir auch Fotos von ihrem Fortschritt geschickt, wobei sie bis auf eine etwas kraeftigere Bauchmuskulatur gewirkt hat wie immer. Nachdem ich mit der Buchhaltung schneller fertig war, als gedacht, hab ich - auch wenn ich natuerlich extrem heiss auf sie war - trotzdem beschlossen, am so gewonnen Samstag Abend einfach zu chillen. Den Umstand, dass fast eine Woche keine sexy Fotos mehr von ihr gekommen sind, sie meine Textnachrichten wie es ihr geht, nur sehr ausweichend beantwortet und manchmal Sachen geschrieben hat wie &lt;&lt; Bin nur vom Training muede und hungrig. Sehne mich nach dir. >>, haette mich aber ebenso alarmieren muessen, wie dass sie mich immer wieder mit Fragen bombardiert hat, ob ich sie noch moechte, sie liebe und dass sie Angst hat, dass ich sie verlasse. Falls doch ein Maedel diesen Post liest und sich denkt: bloeder, unsensibler Typ. Ja, sorry. Hab auch nicht kapiert, dass ich sie extrem gekraenkt habe weil ich das Treffen vom Samstag auf unter die Woche verschoben hab. Aber ihre Antwort &lt;&lt; Nein ist gut, komm klar damit. Vermisse dich einfach so sehr und sehne mich nach dir. >> war zwar extrem suess, klang fuer mich aber auch nicht wie die Katastrophe. Es war also mehr Zufall und weil ich natuerlich schon gespannt war, ob sie durch diese 2-3 Wochen Extremtraining irgendwie noch besser ausschaut, wobei sie ja immer hot as hell ist, dass ich sie am Abend nochmals angerufen haben. Sie klang zwar total happy, mich zu hoeren, gleichzeitig aber auch irgendwie traurig und verheult. Wie ich sie gefragt hab, ob eh alles okay ist, hat sie zu schluchzen begonnen und gemeint, dass ich sie jetzt verlassen wuerde und wurde total panisch. Sie hatte die ganze Woche gefastet, damit ihre Bauchmuskeln, die sie auftrainiert hatte, noch besser definiert sind und das wollte sie mir zeigen und sie hat gemeint, dass sie mir ausser ihrer Figur eh nix bieten kann und wenn ich sie dann trotzdem nicht liebe, was sie dann soll … es war egal, dass ich ihr gesagt habe, dass ich nur rumhaengen wollte und dass ich so schon vorher sexy und wuenderschoen gefunden habe und dass sie sich nicht haette so quaelen muessen und ich trotzdem stolz auf sie waere, wenn sie so toll aussieht … sie hat nur leise geweint und immer wiederholt, dass sie mich liebt und ohne mich nicht leben will … einerseits war ich natuerlich geschmeichelt, andererseits habe ich das schon uebertrieben und nervig und auch etwas bedrohlich gefunden. Nachdem sie mich dann quasi angebettelt hat, ob sie noch kommen darf, hab ich mich dann aber schon gefreut. Natuerlich wollte ich sie. Hab mich also restauriert und auf sie gewartet. Es war schon spaet und nachdem draussen ein eiskalter Wind war und es wie aus Eimern geregnet hat, dachte ich logischerweise, sie wuerde ein Taxi nehmen. Demenstprechend sauer war ich, dass sie nach ueber 1 Stunde noch nicht da war.  Wenn sie schon ungebeten, ungeplant und auf eigenes Bestreben ploetzlich vor der Tuer steht, dann soll sie wenigstens puenktlich sein. Als es dann gelaeutet hat, war ich also entschlossen, ihr eine Standpauke zu halten. Doch ihr Anblick war mitleidserregend und sexy af zu gleich. Sie war trotz Regen, Wind und Kaelte die ganze Strecke mit ihrem alten, rostigen Fahrrad gekommen, dass sie quietschend neben sich herschob. Ihre langen, drahtigen Beine ware nackt und steckten barfuss in schwarzen Converse. Ansonsten trug sie nur einen schwarzen Minirock und ein eng anliegendes, schwarzes Croptop, dass vollkommen in dem eiskalten Regenwasser getränkt, an ihrem Körper klebte. Da sie ihren Fahrradhelm schon abgenommen hatte, umrahmten ihre nassen, dunklen, lockigen Haare ihr wunderschönes, heute aber etwas eingefallen wirkendes Gesicht, mit den großen, hungrigen Augen und ihren zarten Lippen mit den klappernden, weißen Zähnen. Was mich komplett geflasht hat, war der Anblick ihrer Bauchmuskeln. Sie hat immer einen sexy, weil eingesunkenen, flachen Bauch. Aber so wie sie an diesem Abend da stand, hatte ich den Eindruck, dass dieses Maedchen wirklich 0 % Koerperfettanteil hat. Obwohl sie klatschnass war und vor Kaelte gebibbert hat, war ich von ihrem Anblick so hypnotisiert, dass ich sie fast 10 min in der Kaelte stehen hab lassen. Obwohl sie fix und fertig war, hat ihr schuechternes Laecheln und das Glitzern in ihren dunklen Augen doch gezeigt, dass sie erleichtert war, dass sie ihre Wirkung auf mich nicht eingebuesst hat. Ein heftiges Zittern ging ihr durch ihren Koerper und ihr war so kalt, dass sie - was fuer sie ungewoehnlich war - sogar die Arme verschraenkte, was sie ob meiner kurzen aber merkbaren Enttaeuschungsreaktion sofort wieder bleiben liess, nur um mit zarten und eiskalten Fingern meine Hand zu nehmen. &lt;&lt; Ich friere so sehr >>.  Ich schob sie in den Vorraum und knallte die Tuer zu. Als sie bemerkte, dass dies keine aggressive sondern leidenschaftlich Geste war, war da auch wieder dieses zarte Lächeln und der Glow in ihren dunklen Augen. Sie schluepfte aus den Schuhen und versuchte mit ihren kleinen, zarten, blauen und klammen Händen den Verschluss ihres Minirocks zu öffnen. Nachdem sie so zittrig war, half ich ihr und zog sie aus bis sie nackt und noch immer tropfnass vor mir gestanden ist. Ich nahm meine zitternde Schneeelfe in die Arme und streichelte zaertlich ueber die Gaensehaut auf ihrem etwas muskuloesen Ruecken. Ihr kleiner, steinharter Hintern zitterte so heftig, dass ich ihn mit der Hand kaum packen konnte. Sie kuesste mich leidenschaftlich, wobei ich aufpassen musste, dass sie mich nicht in die Zunge biss, weil sie das Klappern ihrer Zaehne nicht unterdruecken konnte. Ich finde es immer so extrem anturnend wenn sie sich auf die Zehenspitzen stellt und ihren schlanken Koerper durchstrecken muss, um mein Gesicht zu erreichen. &lt;&lt; Trag mich >> Ich hab sie hochgehoben und bin direkt mit ihr zur Coach. Es war wie immer der Unterschied: Mir ist der Schweiss von der Stirn getropft, waehrend Carina so gezittert hat, als haette sie Schuettelfrost. Als sie am Ruecken lag und sich ausgestreckt hat, hab ich erst gesehen, wie hart sie an ihrem Bauch gearbeitet hat, aber auch wie ausgehungert sie wieder war. Ich haette den Anblick ihres makelllosen 
Koerper gerne laenger genossen, aber sie fror so extrem, dass ich sie zuerst waermen musste, weil sie zunehmend Zeichen einer schwereren Unterkuehlung gezeigt hat. Es hatte draussen zwar Plusgrade, aber die Naesse und der Wind, die Anstrengung und weil sie doch ziemlich ausgemergelt war (und trotzdem extrem sexy und perfekt), hatte sie komplett ausgepowert. Ich hab mein Hemd ausgezogen und sie hat sich hat ganz eng an mich gekuschelt. Ich hab sie gestreichelt und ihr zittern wurde immer heftiger, wobei es irgendwann nicht nur die Kaelte, sondern auch die Leidenschaft war. Carina war so durchgefroren, dass sie selbst nachdem wir dann noch miteinander geschlafen hatten, unaufhoerlich und heftig weiter gezittert hatte. Ich hab sie ins Bett getragen und sie hat sich so schutzsuchend an mich gekuschelt, um sich zu waermen, dass ich zu gerne nochmals ihre Leidenschaft entfacht haette. Mein Maedchen war aber so fertig, dass sie sofort in meinen Armen eingeschlafen ist. </p>

<p>Hallo Iceman,
ich denke nicht, dass deine Fuersorge fuer Carina dem SM-Spiel widerspricht. Vielmehr denke ich, dass ein guter Dom sich verantwortlich sieht fuer Sub, ja, ihn sogar vor sich selbst beschuetzt - aber dennoch versucht, die Grenzen immer weiter auszudehnen. Deshalb macht es auch einen gewaltigen Unterschied, ob man bei den Kaeltespielen eine Blasenentzuendung riskiert, oder aber trotz bestehender Entzuedung es immer weiter treibt. Ich denke, dass war auch damals der Punkt, bei dem Martins Verantwortungsbewusstsein gegenueber Lisa einen Endpunkt gesetzt hat.</p>

<p>Bei dem von dir wiedergegebenen Erlebnis hast du mit der Terminverschiebung in der Tat einen ziemlichen Bock geschossen - und das nicht nur aus Carinas Sichtweise. Aber das hattest Du ja schon selbst bemerkt.</p>

<p>Ich glaube, manchmal ist dir gar nicht bewusst, wie sehr sie fuer dich (und letztlich natuerlich auch fuer sich) leidet. Wie du schon schreibst, kann man die Kaeltespiele mal machen und mal lassen. Sie kann sich, wenn sie alleine ist, so warm ankleiden, wie sie will. Ich weiss nicht, ob sie sich auch dann mal zu sommerlich kleidet, um dir in Wort und Bild davon zu berichten. Ihren Sport muss sie schon regelmaessig machen, ob du da bist oder nicht - sonst wuerde sie ihre Muskeln nie erzielen. Aber auch dass ist die Zeit, die sie sich am Morgen oder Abend dafuer nimmt. Ihre Diaet muss sie aber immer durchgaengig halten. Gerade wenn sie es mal wieder auf den Punkt bringen will, wird sie das den ganzen Tag begleiten, morgens, wenn sie aufwacht, beim Sport, bei der Arbeit oder wenn sie hungrig wieder im Bett liegt. Waehrend dir vermutlich im Laufe des Tages hunderte von anderen Dingen durch den Kopf gehen, wird sie immer wieder daran erinnert. Sie muss sich immer wieder sagen, dass halte ich aus fuehr IHN. Berichtet sie darueber, wie es ihr an solchen Tagen geht?</p>

<p>Wie laeuft das eigentlich, wenn sie dann so ausgehungert zu dir kommt. Isst sie dann am Abend, nachdem du sie ausfuehrlich bewundert hast noch etwas, bleibt sie hungrig bis zum naechsten morgen oder bleibt sie hungrig um die Spannung zu halten, bis sie wieder geht?</p>

<p>Welche "Maso-Aktionen" hat sie denn noch getrieben, ausser Hungern, Trainieren und Frieren?</p>

<p>Koenntest Du Carina in andere gemeinsame Aktivitaeten einbinden, beruflich oder deinen anderen Interessen? Dass wuerde dann auch gemeinsame Gespraeche auf Augenhoehe geben. - Na gut, ich werde hier nicht als Partnerschaftsberater bezahlt und halte mich da besser raus.</p>

<p>Hast Du Carina schon mal bewusst oder unbewusst "vorgefuehrt" um ihre Figur oder ihren Durchhaltewillen Anderen zu Beweis zu stellen? War es geplant oder spontan? Wusste Carina im Vorfeld von deiner Absicht?</p>

<p>Gruss</p>

<p>Hallo IcemanX, Hallo Ferfred, 
auch ich habe die letzten Posts fast verpasst. IcemanX, du kannst dir nicht vorstellen, wie ich dich um deine Carina beneide. Wie du sie beschreibt, muss sie unglaublich sexy sein und dich abgoettisch lieben, bei all den Qualen, die sie für dich auf sich nimmt. Sie geht bis an die Grenzen des Moeglichen, was ihr Gewicht und ihre Leidensfaehigkeit in Bezug auf ihre Kaeltetoleranz betrifft. Ich kann deinen Zwiespalt zwischen deiner Faszination für ihren extrem frierenden und schlanken Koerper  und die Sorge um ihre Gesundheit sehr gut nachvollziehen. Marcus und du haben dazu das Glueck, dass eure Partnerinnen die sexuelle Lust nicht verloren haben. Ich hatte in meiner Jugend mal eine Freundin, die schon eine sehr sehr schlanke Figur hatte und in eine Magersucht gerutscht ist, sie hat fast nichts mehr gegessen und sich sportlich nicht mehr fit gehalten, ihr sexuelle Lust ging immer weiter gegen Null. Ganz anders erlebe ich Lisa, sie geniesst und sucht koerperliche Naehe und brennt darauf von Marcus sexuell verwoehnt zu werden und hat unglaubliche Angst seinen Erwartungen nicht gerecht zu werden. Carina verhaelt sich aehnlich und hat die gleichen Aengste. Lisa ihr Koerper hat kein Gramm Fett und definierte Muskeln, aber nicht uebertrieben.  Ich erlebe, wie sie sich dafuer quaelt und bin gleichzeitig fasziniert davon, sie in ihrer braungebrannten Gaensehaut zitternd in der groessten Kaelte zu erleben und beruehren zu duerfen. Zur Frage der Oeffentlichkeit habe ich ja schon viel geschrieben. Ja, Lisa zeigt sich mittlerweile ganz ungezwungen und selbstverstaendlich in der Oeffentlichkeit, als Lisa meinen Sohn kennenlernte, war das noch nicht so ausgepraegt, doch mein Sohn lies ihr keine Wahl, am Anfang ihrer Beziehung mit Marcus trug sie manchmal eine Jacke, das aenderte sich aber sehr schnell wieder, heute erlebe ich sie auch ohne Marcus nur in knappen Klamotten. Ob sie das immer aus eigenem Antrieb macht, kann ich nicht sagen, aber ich denke, sie ist sich ihrer Wirkung durchaus bewusst und hat Angst Marcus zu enttaeschen. Ferfred hat Recht, wenn er schreibt, dass es einen gewaltigen Unterschied macht, ob man bei den Kaeltespielen eine Blasenentzuendung riskiert, oder aber trotz bestehender Entzuedung es immer weiter treibt. Ich hatte an dem besagten Tag schon vorher mitbekommen, dass Lisa eine Blasenentzuendung hatte und nach Stunden in der Kaelte an dem Tag am Ende ihrer Kraefte war, sie ist wirklich oft krank, was sie aber nicht zugibt und ihr scheinbar nichts ausmacht, sie ist immer froehlich und gut gelaunt. Doch an diesem Tag war es anders und ich bereue nicht, dass ich eingegriffen habe. Deshalb IcemanX, bitte passe auf deine Schneeelfe auf, manchmal muss man sie vor sich selbst schuetzen, auch wenn die Faszination darin besteht Grenzen zu finden und zu ueberschreiten. Auch wenn ich im Nachhinein grosse Gewissensbisse habe, muss ich gestehen, dass ich diese Grenzen auch manchmal unbewusst testen moechte, so war es schon empfindlich kühl und Lisa war schon mit mir und meinem kleinen Neffen den ganzen Nachmittag auf dem Spielplatz. Es faszinierte mich Lisa zu beobachten, ihre Muskeln und ihren makellosen Koerper zu erleben, der mehr und mehr von der Kaelte eingenommen wurde, kein Wunder, Lisa trug wiedermal nur eine Art Bikinioberteil und einen Minirock auf ihrer Gaensehaut, dazu war sie barfuss. Ich konnte es kaum erwarten, bis sie zu mir kam und mich nach der naechste Zigarette zu fragen. Nachdem wir meinen Neffen nach Hause gebracht haben, lud ich sie noch auf einen Schoppen Wein ein. Lisa war vergnuegt und freute sich. 
Mittlerweile war die Sonne untergegangen und Lisa fuehlte sich eiskalt an, trotzdem habe ich sie nicht gefragt, wo sie sitzen moechte, sondern wir haben einfach im Freien Platz genommen. Ich war fasziniert mich mit Lisa zu unterhalten, sie dabei in ihrer extremen Gaensehaut im Abendlicht zu sehen, in einer zitternden Hand ihre Zigarette und in der anderen zitternden Hand das Weinglas. Und doch unterhielt sie sich, wenn auch mit klappernden Zaehnen, ganz normal mit mir. Als ich Lisa wieder einmal auf ihren uebermaessigen Zigarettenkonsum ansprach und mir Lisa gestand, dass sie Angst habe Marcus seinen Erwartungen in Bezug auf ihre Figur nicht zu erfüllen, beruhigte ich sie, dass sie nicht besser aussehen koenne, aber auch ihre Gesundheit im Blick haben solle, trotzdem fragte ich sie kurze Zeit spaeter im Beisein des Kellners nachdem ich mein Essen bestellt habe: Lisa, du bist sicher auch hungrig, darf ich dir einen Salat bestellen? Oder muss heute wieder eine Zigarette reichen? Lisa strich ueber ihre Bauchmuskeln: Nein, danke, keinen Salat, ich muss doch auf meine Figur achten, da muessen wirklich ein paar Zigaretten reichen. Da war es wieder mein schlechtes Gewissen, ich wusste, dass Lisa extrem hungrig war und doch habe ich sie mit meiner Fragestellung dazu gebracht, den Salat abzulehnen. Auch als ich ihr ein paar Pommes von meinem Teller angeboten habe, zeigte sie mir nur ihre Zigarette: Die muss reichen, der Wein hat schon genug Kalorien. Doch damit nicht genug, ich spuerte die Kaelte des Abends schon mehr als deutlich, obwohl ich relativ warm angezogen war, fragte ich mich, ob es nicht angebracht waere Lisa nach Hause zu bringen, doch irgendwie ferngesteuert fragte ich Lisa, als der Kellner meinen Teller holte, ob ich uns noch einen Schoppen Wein bestellen darf, obwohl ich gesehen habe, dass es Lisa immer schwerer fiel ihre Zitteranfaelle in den Griff zu bekommen. Das bemerkte natuerlich auch der Kellner, er starrte auf Lisa ihre Nippel, die sich durch ihr winziges BikiniTop bohren wollten und bot uns einen Tisch im Restaurant an. Wir sassen auf der einzigen Bank, die nicht unter einem Schirm mit Heizpilz stand. Ich  nahm Lisa in den Arm, fuehlte ihre zitternden Muskeln unter ihrer Gaensehaut und fragte: Du zitterst so heftig, dir wird es sicher zu kalt hier draussen, moechtest du reingehen? Lisa rutschte noch naeher zu mir, so konnte ich ihren zitternden Koerper durch meine dicke Jacke noch deutlicher spueren, gab mir einen Kuss und meinte mit klappernden Zaehnen darauf nur: Danke, bin echt durchgefroren, aber Marcus liebt dieses Top, in deinem Arm spuere ich kaum , wie kalt mir ist, bitte lass uns hier bleiben, ich fuehle mich hier am wohlsten. Wir haben noch lange dort gesessen ...

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Hier ist ja nicht mehr viel los, Lisa schlaegt sich tapfer, Marcus besteht darauf Lisa fast taeglich im See zu trainieren. Das Ergebnis kann sich sehen lassen, Lisa sieht umwerfend aus, kein bisschen Fett, nur zitternde Muskeln, aber keinesfalls uebertrieben. Auch waehrend der Feiertage hat Lisa nicht ein Gramm zugelegt. Ich habe sie Silvester und Neujahr beobachtet, waehrend wir ausgiebig schlemmten und sich Marcus beklagte, dass er zu viel gegessen habe, mussten Lisa Zigaretten, Kaffee und mal ein Glas Rotwein reichen. Als ich Lisa fragte, ob sie nicht wenigstens eine Kleinigkeit essn moechte, legte Marcus seine Hand auf ihren Oberschenkel und meinte: Nein, besser nicht, moechte doch hier keine Fettpolster fuehlen.  Zu meiner Freude moechte mein kleiner Neffe oft mit Lisa auf den Spielplatz, so kann ich mit Lisa gemeinsamen unterwegs sein. Ich bin jedesmal aufs Neue von Lisa fasziniert. Obwohl es doch recht kuehl ist und sie seit Wochen erkaeltet ist, traegt Lisa fast nichts auf ihrer Gaensehaut und geht dazu oft noch barfuss.

<p>Hallo Frogger,
Ich freue mich von dir zu hoeren, wie bringt man seine Freundin dazu barfuss in der Kaelte zu laufen? Ich glaube Lisa hat Angst Marcus zu enttaeuschen. Letzte Woche war ich mit Lisa und meinem kleinen Neffen auf dem Spielplatz, Lisa kam uns abholen, obwohl sie schlimm erkaeltet war, doch wie immer trug sie fast nichts auf ihrer Gaensehaut und war schon total durchgefroren. Kein Wunder, sie kam direkt von ihrem Schwimmtraining im See zu uns. Ich bat sie herein, mein Neffe  empfing sie freudig und wollte sofort auf den Spielplatz. Ich: Lisa muss sich erstmal aufwaermen. Lisa zitterte jetzt in der Waerme noch viel intensiver, sie musste sich setzen, doch mit klappernden Zaehnen meinte sie: Lass uns gehen, die Sonne kommt gerade heraus. Hast du vielleicht ein paar Zigaretten für mich. Ich brachte ihr eine Schachtel Zigaretten und eine Jacke von mir und sagte, waehrend ich mit meiner Hand ueber ihren nackten blaumarmorierten Ruecken strich: Oh Gott, so kannst du nicht noch laenger in die Kaelte, du fuehlst dich jetzt schon eiskalt an, denke an den eisigen Wind heute. Lisa nahm die Schachtel Zigaretten, doch sie hatte Muehe mit ihrem zitternden Körper die Schachtel zu oeffnen und erst recht die Zigarette zwischen ihren blauen Lippen zu halten. Ich zuendete ihr die Zigarette an und erschrak, wie eiskalt sich ihr Oberarm anfuehlte. Lisa: Oh ja, bin schon echt durchgefroren, barfuss ist jetzt echt hart, aber Marcus steht darauf. Ich: Bitte ziehe doch  die Jacke an. Lisa hustete und zog dennoch heftig an ihrer Zigarette, die sie kaum halten konnte, weil sie weiter heftig zitterte: Nein, bitte keine Jacke, Marcus waere enttäuscht, er sucht die Klamotten fuer mich aus. Er hat erst heute frueh gemeint, dass es gut ist, dass es keine minusgrade hat und ich mein Sommeroutfit tragen kann und ich doch dazu sicher gern barfuss gehen moechte. Sie schaute auf ihre blaeuliche Gaensehaut am Arm und strich mit ihrer zitternden Hand ueber ihren nackten Oberschenkel und meinte: Hast Recht, so kann ich nicht schon wieder raus. Das kalte Wasser und der eisige Wind sind nicht gut fuer meine Haut. Hast du vielleicht etwas Bodylotion fuer mich? Ich holte ihr die Bodylotion, waehrend wir unsere Winterklamotten anzogen, cremte sich Lisa ein und ich durfte ihr dabei behilflich sein, was ich sehr genoss. Ich konnte jeden zitternden Muskel unter ihrer Gaensehaut fuehlen. Ich war fasziniert: Lisa du hast eine Traumfigur und ich bewundere dich dafuer, aber es ist heute zu kalt ohne Jacke, du wirst furchtbar frieren. Lisa gab mir einen Kuss: Danke Martin, tut so gut ein Kompliment von dir zu hören, moechte meine Figur nicht verstecken, auch wenn ich deshalb noch so frieren muss, das erwartet Marcus von mir und ich kann ihn doch nicht enttaeschen. Lisa sah umwerfend, ihre Gaensehaut glaenzte im Sonnenlicht und wir wanderten zum Spielplatz und verbrachten fast zwei Stunden dort...
Frogger, was traegt deine Freundin bei kalten Temperaturen? Hast du sie ueberzeugen koennen auch mal barfuss zu gehen? Wie verhaelt sie sich, wenn sie stark friert? Ist sie im Winter auch staendig krank?
LG Martin    </p>

<p>Hi Martin thanks for replying:)
Lisa is so amazing! A true shivering ice godess.
We live in Norway and it can get really cold here so most of the time my girlfriend wears jeans, and I have a huge fetish for girls in jeans so I like that she wears that, but I have made her make a lot of holes and rips in her jeans so they don't warm her too much:) She also never wears socks or stockings no matter how cold it gets. She usually wears a short t-shirt and in winter a leather jacket or denim jacket. She dosn't own any winter coats.And when its a bit warmer like 5c she doesn't wear a jacket when I am with her. On her feet she is mostly in sneakers. I convince her sometimes to go barefoot outside. Like on New years eve, due to Covid restrictions it was just us 2 and a firend celbreating with us. She wore a very short sleeveless mini dress and of course no socks or stockings. It was around -5c and we stayed outside for around and an hour watching the fireworks, and she was barefoot all the time. And last weekend we was at a firends birthday party. It was -8c, she is a party smoker and had to smoke outside in the backgarden. She did that many times and was barefoot all that time.
She cathes colds very often, she almost have a chronic cough, but if anyone asks her she blames her smoking..

<p>Hallo Frogger,
ich bin nicht so besonders daran interessiert, dass eine Frau barfuss unterwegs ist. Ich finde Highheels viel interessanter, auch gerade bei Gelegenheiten, die nicht unbedingt dafuer geeignet sind. Aber vielleicht ist genau das eine Idee, wie du deine Freundin ganz unschuldig dazu bekommen kannst, doch barfuss zu laufen: Du laesst dich auf einen Kompromiss ein, dass sie Schuhe anziehen darf, aber die, die du aussuchst. Wenn ihr dann etwas laenger unterwegs seid, zieht sie die dann wahrscheinlich freiwillig aus und laeuft barfuss, weil es ihr zu anstrengend ist, weiter in Highheels zu laufen. ;-)</p>

<p>Magst Du uns ueber ein paar "kuehle Situationen" berichten, die ihr gemeinsam erlebt habt? Was ist ihre Motiviation, sich duenn zu kleiden? Will sie vor allem dir einen Gefallen machen, will sie ihren Koerper immer zeigen oder geniesst sie die Bewunderung der Beobachter?</p>

<p>Lieber Gruss
Ferfred </p>

<p>Hello Frogger,
I'm not particularly interested in a woman going barefoot. I find high heels much more interesting, especially on occasions that are not necessarily suitable for them. But maybe this is an idea how you can innocently get your girlfriend to go barefoot after all: You compromise that she can wear shoes, but the ones you choose. If you are out and about a little longer, she will probably take them off voluntarily and walk barefoot because it is too exhausting for her to continue walking in high heels. ;-)</p>

<p>Would you like to tell us about a few "chilly situations" you've experienced together? What is her motivation for dressing skinny? Does she mainly want to do you a favor, does she always want to show her body or does she enjoy the admiration of the observers?</p>

<p>Warm wishes
Ferfred</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,
erzaehl doch mal etwas genauer ueber diesen Ausflug.</p>

<p>Wann habt ihr euch denn getroffen? War Lisa alleine zum Schwimmtraining oder hat Marcus sie gebracht und abgeholt?</p>

<p>Was meinst Du, warum Lisa bei Dir Zigaretten haben wollte? Wollte sie sich doch einen Moment aufwaermen ohne es direkt zugeben zu muessen? Oder meinst Du, dass sie nach dem Schwimmtraining so Hunger hatte, dass sie es ohne Zigaretten nicht mehr aushielt? Du hast ihr ja eine Jacke angeboten. Bietest Du ihr auch manchmal etwas zu Essen an, erwartend, dass sie es eh ablehnen wird? Erwaehnt sie auch manchmal von selbst, dass sie Hunger hat oder was sie am Tag bis zu eurem Treffen bereits gegessen hat?</p>

<p>Wie reagieren eigentlich die Passanten auf dem Spielplatz oder unterwegs, die sie nicht kennen?</p>

<p>Du machst Dir ja manchmal Sorgen, dass sie zu viel raucht. Ich denke, Du wirst da bei ihr nichts erreichen. Der einzige Schluessel ist Marcus. Er muss ihr sagen, dass er wuenscht, dass sie das Rauchen einstellt. So im Hinblick auf: Ich moechte eine gesunde Freundin wegen Kinder, mit guter Kondition, ohne Krebs, ... und dass sie ja so super diszipliniert immer sei, dass sie ihr Gewicht auch ohne zu rauchen halten und/oder weiter reduzieren koenne - davon sei er ganz ueberzeugt. Er stehe halt einfach auf super disziplinierte, durchhaltewillige Frauen etc.
Was meinst Du?</p>

<p>Immer neugierig auf weitere Erlebnisse

<p>Hi Ferfred, thanks for replying to me:)</p>

<p>I'm like you and love high heels on women, unfortunately my girlfriend is not so fond of wearing it so often.
But I know she really wants a pair of Louboutin heels, so I'll try your advice to buy them for her, I guess they will be so painful so she takes them off an walk barefoot after a night in them :)</p>

<p>Have a very nice situation from the Christmas season, it lasted a nice but very cold day -12c and we decided to head into town for a lunch. I told her we were not going to be out that much so she did not have to think about it when she got dressed.
So she dressed as if it was a slightly warmer day, she was wearing very ripped, very tight, cropped skinny jeans, a short t-shirt, a short thin faux leather jacket and low Converese without socks. Fortunately, I have managed to persuade her to throw away all her socks and stockings, so she always walks barefoot in shoes and at home.
We have about 15 minutes to walk to the train to town and she got pretty cold when we went and said she was glad we were in most of the time.
When we got to town we went to a resturant and ate lunch, she only ate a light salad. She eats quite a bit as she wants to stay as thin as possible, something I very much support.
After we had eaten, I asked since it was such nice weather if we should go for a walk in a winter park that was set up in the center in connection with Christmas, she looked a little skeptical but agreed.
We ended up walking around outside for over 2 hours, she got so cold that she gritted her teeth constantly, it was as far as she could smoke because she was shaking her hands and that her teeth chattered so much. She told me after about 1 hour that she no longer felt her legs and had no feeling in her feet anymore. and through the holes in her jeans I saw goosebumps. 
I asked if she wanted to go home, but she said that if I wanted to go around a little more to see, it would be fine for her. I said I would like to go a little more, I told her that she should smoke a little more so she got some heat in her. I think she's so sexy when she smokes that I encourage her to smoke as often as I can.
After about 1 hour more we went home, the train ride home takes 10 minutes and during the whole train ride she sat rubbing her thighs. I put a hand on one of her thighs and it was freezing cold. And during the 15 minute walk home she had tears in her eyes from the cold, she could barely speak due to chattering teeth and I think she only managed to smoke a cigarette on the walk. The only thing she said was that the cold felt worse as her feet had gotten a little warm on the train also out again in the cold
When we got home I checked the thermometer and it was now -16c, feels like -23c it said.
She was so cold and froze so badly when she came home that I made a cup of hot tea for her and put a blanket over her, I normally never do this but now I feel sorry for her. Her feet were completely red and felt like icicles, so I massaged them to life again. The rest of the evening she sat right next to me wanting me to hold her around all the time since she was still frozen like that. I was very excited to know her cold body :)
Also have a nice situation from last weekend when I had a birthday, can tell it what you want?
Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hi Frogger,
thanks for sharing your experience with us. Of course we like to learn more about your girlfriend ;-)</p>

<p>She also seems to be very tough and brave. What do you think is here main motivation? Is it just doing you a favor, does she love the cold, does she enjoy the looks and admiration of onlookers, or is she just showing off the assets of her body?</p>

<p>Obviously I would prefer the dress style of Lisa as Martin describes it. It would be very sexy and daring already in summer, but in winter you can see here shivering muscles and goosebumps ... and it's obvious to everyone. Maybe that's not realistic for your weather conditions in winter, but maybe in spring and autumn. </p>

<p>You also mentioned that she likes to stay as thin as possible. Is she also in strict dieting like Lisa? In the case of Lisa, it almost seems as if Marcus still wants to show in front of third parties that Lisa can stand her hunger for hours. Do you have similar "games"?</p>

<p>A curious Ferfred</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred:) Nice to hear form you again.</p>

<p>My GF is very good looking and she knows it;) she like to show of her body and like admiration. 
If we had not been together I think she would have dressed a bit warmer than she is doing now.
I have thing foor feet and cold feet in particularly, so I have manged to get her to throw away all her socks and stockings and wear shoes barefoot
and inside she is barefoot always no matter how cold the floor she is walking on is, I love when her if is very cold and red from coldness:)
In the cold winter we have her she unfortunately have to wear a jacket, it she was to walk outside barearmed I think people would think she was crazy and lock ur in lol.
Another thing I have a thing for is women in jeans and specially ripped jeans, I prefer that over skirts and shorts. 
I think she would have worn more skirts if it wasn't for me. She usally wears very ripped jeans all the time, and I love that alot.
She is always on a diett wanting to stay very thin, but not a strict as LIsa I belive. She normally eats twice a day.I would like her to stay hungrier for longer than she usally do, but I wont force her to do that.
But I encourage to eat less, and says if she says she is very hungry that mabee if she smokes some more cigarettes she wont feel the hunger so much.
And when we eat out I always try to order just a small salad for her.
I know I am very lucky to be with such a beautiful women who dress as I like and will be freezing cold just for me:)</p>

<p>Last weekend (Sunday) was my birthday she woke me up after she had been at the gym, she goes to the gym 5-6 times a week, she congratulated me and asked if we should go for a long walk with our dog after she had gotten a shower a gotten dressed.
So we did, it was aound 3c and her hair was still wet from her shower, shre dressed in her usally tight ripped jeans, a thank top without a bra and flipflops! She asked how I think she looked and said she dressed like this as part of my bithday present, she also whisperd that she wasn't wearing any underwear.
We walked for over 1 hour and she chainsmoked all that time, she also became very cold, chattrering her teeth and had huge goosebumps on her arms and also visable on her tights through the rips in her jeans.
And her nipples where cleray visable in her top. Her toes and feet was bright red and I knew they must be freezing:)
When we got back home with our dog, she asked if we sbould go and watch a local ski competition which some children of our friends was participating in, I saud sure and we walked there..
She was still dressed the same and I asked if she would like to put on some moresince we would be standing i the snow awhile, but she said no as I told you me dressing like this is part of your birthday present. I will not wear any more clothes today.
We whatched the race for about 1 hour or so and our frieds asked why she wore so little and she said she was so warm even when if her goosebumps and teeth said otherwise, and not to mentuon her naked feet standing on snow ground.
After that went to eat at resturant about 20 min walk, she got a lot of looks from people I a saw that she liked it.
After we had had dinner and got home we got the dog a long walk again, she still dressed the same, but no she was obviously freezing a lot more than earlier, her hole body was shaking when she stould still and her hands shook so much she had a hard time smoking.
Her hair which still hadn't dryed completly hung very cold on her and her feet looked atleast to me blueish.
When we got back home we saw that the temp now was -4c. I asked If she would like to take a warm shower and if I should make her some hot tea.
But she refused saying no comes the second part of your birthday present for you to tuch my freezing body and warm it. She then put her cold wet feet into my lap, and they felt so wonderfully cold in my hands:)
I have some more stories of her maybee not as good, but if you like I can try to tell them?
And how is your Ice Princess doing?</p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, moechte dir noch deine Fragen beantworten:</p>

<p>Wann habt ihr euch denn getroffen? War Lisa alleine zum Schwimmtraining oder hat Marcus sie gebracht und abgeholt?</p>

<p>Marcus ist meist mit dabei, er hat sicher Freude daran Lisa zu trainieren, wenn ich mal mit dabei bin laeuft es etwa so ab: wir laufen zum See, was es Lisa auch besonders schwer macht, so kommt sie schon total ausgekühlt am See an und muss dann noch in das eiskalte Wasser, nach einer Runde im See meint Marcus: Jetzt hast du dir erst mal eine Pause verdient. Lisa schafft es dann trotz heftiger Zitteranfaelle hintereinander zwei, drei Zigaretten zu rauchen, bevor Marcus sie auffordert: Lisa, eine Runde musst du schon noch schwimmen. Letztens war es so kalt und Lisa so erkaeltet, dass Marcus Lisa in den Arm nahm, sie kuesste und meinte:  Du frierst ja echt heftig, heute ist es wirklich zu kalt fuer eine zweite Runde. Lisa klammerte sich an Marcus, zitterte unglaublich und war kaum zu verstehen: Ja, es wird jeden Tag kaelter, aber bin ich doch gewoehnt, ich schwimme noch eine Runde. Marcus kuesste Lisa noch intensiver, waehrend seine Haende ueber ihren nackten Ruecken und Po wanderten: So mag ich dich. Nach der zweiten Runde kommt sie manchmal so erschoepft aus dem Wasser, dass sie kaum noch laufen kann. Trotzdem ist sie immer gut gelaunt und zu Scherzen aufgelegt. Doch damit nicht genug, auch nach einer zweiten Runde im See gibt er Lisa keine Gelegenheit, sich aufzuwaermen, fragt sie dann noch, ob es ihr nicht zu kalt wird, wenn wir noch etwas im Freien unterwegs sein werden. Doch Lisa entgegnet mit klappernden Zaehnen dann nur: Ach was, auf mich muesst ihr keine Ruecksicht nehmen.  
Nach so einem Training hat Marcus seine Lisa zu mir gebracht, er musste irgendetwas Geschaeftliches erledigen und meinte: Ich komme dann zum Spielplatz und hole euch ab. Natuerlich wollte Lisa nun nichts als Gaensehaut tragen, wenn Marcus sie abholte. </p>

<p>Was meinst Du, warum Lisa bei Dir Zigaretten haben wollte? Wollte sie sich doch einen Moment aufwaermen ohne es direkt zugeben zu muessen? Oder meinst Du, dass sie nach dem Schwimmtraining so Hunger hatte, dass sie es ohne Zigaretten nicht mehr aushielt? </p>

<p>Zumindest hat sie ein bisschen Waerme dringend nötig gehabt. Nicht nur ihre Lippen waren blau, auch ihre Gaensehaut hatte einen blaeulichen Schimmer. Ich denke beides, sie haelt es ohne Zigaretten nicht aus, sie kann damit ihr Hungergefuehl etwas daempfen.</p>

<p>Du hast ihr ja eine Jacke angeboten. Bietest Du ihr auch manchmal etwas zu Essen an, erwartend, dass sie es eh ablehnen wird?</p>

<p>Ich habe ihr Obst angeboten, doch sie hat sich an ihren nackten eingefallenen Bauch gefasst: Oh, nein, kann ich mir nicht erlauben, bei mir sieht man sofort jede Kleinigkeit. </p>

<p>Erwaehnt sie auch manchmal von selbst, dass sie Hunger hat oder was sie am Tag bis zu eurem Treffen bereits gegessen hat?</p>

<p>Manchmal gesteht sie mir, dass sie Hunger hat oder dass sie den ganzen Tag noch nichts gegessen hat, besonders wenn ich sie auf ihren uebermaessigen Zigarettenkonsum oder ihren knurrenden Magen anspreche.</p>

<p>Wie reagieren eigentlich die Passanten auf dem Spielplatz oder unterwegs, die sie nicht kennen?</p>

<p>Ganz unterschiedlich, die meisten schauen immer und immer wieder zu Lisa und beobachten sie, sprechen sie dann auch mal auf ihre Gaensehaut an und fragen, ob sie nicht friert. Lisa geht sehr offen mit interessierten Fremden um, unterhaelt sich ganz ungezwungen mit ihnen. Seltener gibt es auch beleidigende Kommentare oder jetzt in der Coronazeit Anfeindungen wegen ihrer Hustenanfaelle.</p>

<p>Du machst Dir ja manchmal Sorgen, dass sie zu viel raucht. Ich denke, Du wirst da bei ihr nichts erreichen. Der einzige Schluessel ist Marcus. Er muss ihr sagen, dass er wuenscht, dass sie das Rauchen einstellt. So im Hinblick auf: Ich moechte eine gesunde Freundin wegen Kinder, mit guter Kondition, ohne Krebs, ... und dass sie ja so super diszipliniert immer sei, dass sie ihr Gewicht auch ohne zu rauchen halten und/oder weiter reduzieren koenne - davon sei er ganz ueberzeugt. Er stehe halt einfach auf super disziplinierte, durchhaltewillige Frauen etc. Was meinst Du?</p>

<p>Das habe ich schon versucht, anfangs hat mir Marcus Recht gegeben und Lisa ins Gewissen geredet, wenn sie eine Zigarette nach der anderen rauchte. Doch mittlerweile unterstuezt er sie fast. Er hat immer eine volle Schachtel in seiner Jackentasche und Lisa muss ihn nur anschauen, schon reicht er ihr die Zigarettenschachtel. Wenn wir unterwegs sind und etwas essen, legt er Lisa die Schachtel hin und fragt Lisa: Dir reichen doch sicher deine Zigaretten? Lisa traut sich dann hoechstens noch einen Espresso zu bestellen und raucht ohne Pause eine Zigarette nach der anderen.
Wenn wir unterwegs sind, raucht Lisa auch fast ununterbrochen, Marcus meinte dazu vor einiger Zeit zu mir: Lass sie doch, stoert doch hier keinen und tut ihrer Figur gut.</p>

<p>VG Martin </p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>

<p>Love to hear about Lisa, she is a freezing godess:)
I so understand that Marcus want her to smoke and stay thin.
Slim, thin women who smokes alot is so sexy.
I encourage my girlfriend all the time too smoke more and it seems to help, she now usally chainsmoke all the time when she is home and I also think it helps her to eat less just like Lisa.</p>

<p>Hallo frogger,
Schön von dir zu hören, es freut mich, dass deine Freundin sehr gut aussieht und alles für dich tut, wie heißt deine Freundin? Herzlichen Glückwunsch zu deinem Geburtstag und dem Geschenk deiner Freundin, war sicher grossartig. Hat es dich stolz gemacht, wenn alle deine Freundin beobachtet haben? Sicher war zu sehen, dass sie keinen BH trägt. Konnte sie ihre Zigarette noch selbst anzünden? Lisa zittert manchmal so stark, dass sie Probleme damit bekommt, auch  weil ihre Zähne zu sehr klappern. 
Hat deine Freundin eure Freunde mit einer Umarmung begrüßt? Lisa lässt sich zur Begrüßung gern umarmen und gibt auf Nachfrage auch zu, dass sie friert, ihr das aber nichts ausmacht. 
Wenn deine Freundin sich dünner anzieht, wenn ihr zusammen seid, dann macht sie das nur für dich. Versuchst du sie davon zu überzeugen, dass sie weniger anzieht, wenn sie allein unterweg ist? Marcus besteht darauf, dass Lisa auch dann nur nackte Gänsehaut trägt, wenn er nicht mit dabei ist. Trägt deine Freundin nur deshalb eine Jacke, damit die Leute sie nicht für verrückt halten oder wäre es ihr zu kalt? Lisa geniesst die Bewunderung der Leute und zeigt gern nackte Haut bei jedem Wetter, aber bei euch ist es auch viel kälter. Gut, dass du deine Freundin dazu gebracht hast ihre Strümpfe wegzuwerfen, so muss sie ständig barfuß laufen. Schade, dass du keine Röcke magst, Lisa trägt fast immer superkurze Miniröcke, finde ich total sexy und ihre schlanken Beinen kommen so perfekt zu Geltung. Sicher sehen zerrissene Jeans auch total gut aus, doch Marcus würde Lisa niemals erlauben ihre nackten Beine zu bedecken. Klar erklären Fremde und Freunde diesen Kleidungsstil für verrückt, doch wenn Lisa dann durchgefroren auf seinem Schoss sitzt, liebt er es ihre zitternden blaugefrorenen Oberschenkel in der grössten Kälte zu streicheln, zu erklären und sie zu motivieren: So liebe ich dich, nichts als Gänsehaut, du musst doch nichts unter dicken Klamotten verstecken. Schade, dass wir schon nach Hause müssen, dir wird es sicher zu kalt. Auch wenn Lisa noch so friert antwortet sie: Nein, nein wir müssen nicht nach Hause. Egal, wie kalt ich bin, bei dir fühle ich mich heiss. 
Ich muss zugeben, dass ich es auch genieße, ihre extreme Gänsehaut auf ihren nackten Beinen zu betrachten und sie auch berühren zu dürfen. Doch ihre nackten Beinen zum Minirock sind im Winter nicht die größte Herausforderung, viel stärker friert Lisa durch den Verzicht auf Jacken und wärmende Oberbekleidung. Marcus sucht und kauft für Lisa die Klamotten aus, ist vielleicht auch eine Idee für dich. Ich habe Lisa im letzten Winter nie in einer Jacke gesehen, zwar gab es bei uns kaum Frost, doch ich fand, dass Marcus in seinen Erwartungen immer extremer wird, Lisa trägt nur dünne bauchfreie Spaghettiträger-Tops oder Bikinioberteile, so gekleidet und oft sogar barfuß, erwartet er von Lisa, dass sie stundenlang mit ihm im Freien unterwegs ist, zwischendurch absolviert sie noch ihr Schwimmtraining. Einerseits fasziniert es mich Lisa so zu erleben, ihren eiskalten zitternden Körper zu umarmen,  andererseits mache ich mir aber auch große Sorgen um Lisa. Sie ist wirklich hart zu sich selbst, obwohl sie schlimm erkältet war, hat sie  nie gedrängt ins Warme zu kommen oder etwas überzuziehen. 
Deine Freundin wird sich freuen, dass du sie bei ihrer Diät unterstützt, aber bitte zwinge sie zu nichts, ich glaube es ist schon schwer genug für sie nur zwei mal am Tag zu essen. Da kannst glücklich sein, eine Freundin zu haben, die auf ihre Figur achtet. Klar kannst du sie mal fragen, ob ihr eine Zigarette reicht, während du dir etwas zu Essen bestellst. Sicher hilft das  Rauchen ihr Hungergefuehl zu unterdrücken, doch bitte sei auch hier vorsichtig. Lisa hat schon immer geraucht, aber je strenger sie Diät hielt, umso extremer wurde ihr Zigarettenkonsum, sie raucht wirklich extrem viel, es müssen mehrere Schachteln am Tag sein. Sie isst wirklich nur noch sehr wenig und hält ihren Kreislauf mit Kaffee und Zigaretten in Schwung. </p>

<p>Hi Martin, thanks for your reply:)
My girlfriend's name is Hanne. 
I really like that others look at her. It is easily visible when she is not wearing a bra, the tops she wears are always very narrow and her nipples are quite big. We Norwegians are not very hugging people and since Covid we probably do it even less lol. She often freezes and trembles so I have to light the cigarettes for her.
She never dresses in warm clothes whether she is not with me or not, she also has no choice as she does not own warm clothes haha.
When it is as cold as -15c, -20c, she would probably have worn a jacket even if she was not looked at strangely, at least if she had been out for a long time. But she only owns thin leather jackets and denim jackets. She wears a dress / skirt sometimes, such as for Christmas and New Year, when she wore a short sleeveless black dress, and she likes to wear dresses herself.
But as mentioned, I have a huge fetish for jeans on women, so I prefer that she wears jeans  all the time, so usually she always wears it. And she always wear extremely tight jeans. I also convinced her throw away all her sweatpants and chilling clothes along with her socks and stockings :) She wears training tights when she's at the gym (she trains 5-6 days a week) But other than that she almost always wears ripped jeans and always when we are at home.
Now it is fortunately so "warm here" from 1c-10c that she no longer wears a jacket, and wears mostly short tops and t-shirts.
And I try to get her to only wear flip-flops when she's out (unfortunately she only wears high heels when she dresses up) so she's always very cold on her feet and the last week she's done it :) Love to look at  and feel her icy feet. 
For Christmas we celebrated with my parents and they have very cold stone floors where they live and Hanne went as usual barefoot there too, my mother asked several times if she did not freeze and wanted to borrow some thick socks or slippers but Hanne said no she was not cold, even though I knew her feet were so cold she had almost no feeling in them.
Hanne, like Lisa, has an almost chronic cold and coughs quite a lot, so now with covid I have made her smoke a lot more so she can say it is because of smoke she coughs so much so people do not think she has covid lol.
I try to get her to only eat once a day, she loves dinner type food, so I have said that if she only eats dinner then can eat a little more then, but she says she will be so hungry at dafen if she does not eat some lunch that she fails to focus on studies and work. But I know she's trying to skip lunch and rather just smoke more cigarettes when she's hungry.
Hope she can do it, I just love to see her thin, hungry and cold :) (But wont not push her so she hurts herself)
But she has a long way to go before she's at Lisa's level.
Do you have any good tips and advice to get her to eat less and smoke more? And also to almost always wear open toe shoes or be barefoot?</p>

<p>Sincerely, Frogger</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,</p>

<p>es hat ja in den letzten zwei Wochen noch mal einen richtigen Kaelteeinbruch bei uns gegeben. Wie hat sich Lisa da geschlagen?</p>

<p>Du hast mal erzaehlt, das Lisa immer quer durch den See schwimmt, damit sie nicht abbrechen kann und durchhalten muss. Ist das immer noch so? Ist das ein oeffentlicher Badesee mit Publikumsverkehr? Wenn Sie dort fast taeglich hingeht, koennte ich mir gut vorstellen, dass sie dort schon eine Fangemeinde hat.</p>

<p>Wird Lisa nur wegen ihrer sommerlichen Kleidung angesprochen oder auch wegen ihrer Figur? Du schreibst ja, dass sie offen darueber redet, dass sie wegen ihrer (fehlenden) Keidung schon stark friert. Spricht sie auch offen darueber, wie stark sie hungert um ihre Figur zu halten?</p>

<p>Meinst Du, sie schafft es nur mit dem vielen Rauchen ihre Diaet zu halten? Icemans Carina scheint es ja auch irgendwie ohne Rauchen zu schaffen. Natuerlich wuerde Lisa am Anfang "Amok laufen", wenn sie weder genuegend essen noch rauchen darf, aber letztlich wuerde es ihr bestimmt gut tun. Und sie ist ja recht hart gegen sich selbst. </p>

<p>Wenn ihr gemeinsam zum Essen geht und Marcus legt ihr nahe doch nichts fuer sich zu bestellen, entweder durch Worte oder durch das Hinlegen der Zigaretten, ist das fuer sie dann schon "normal" geworden oder verraten ihre Augen, Gesten oder Worte doch, dass sie sehr gerne wenigstens eine Kleinigkeit essen wuerde? Kommt die Aufforderung von Marcus eher verdeckt nur an Lisa oder platziert er es bewusst so, dass Kellner und/oder Freunde das mitbekommen?</p>

<p>Schoene Gruesse
Ferfred</p>

<p>Hallo Frogger,</p>

<p>was genau gefaellt dir daran, dass Hanne so wenig isst? Wahrscheinlich ist es eine Mischung meherer Aspekte, aber was steht im Vordergrund: Gefallen Dir einfach sehr duenne Frauen? Macht es dich an, dass sie fuer Dich hungert? Gefaellt es Dir zu beobachten, wie sie gegen ihren Hunger ankaempft? Oder zeigst du gerne eine so schlanke Freundin vor oder eine Freundin, die sich sehr gut im Griff hat und auch in Gesellschaft nichts essen muss?</p>

<p>Wie hat sie sich bezueglich Kleidung (abgesehen von den nackten Fuessen) und Essen euber Weihnachten bei deinen Eltern und ueber den Jahreswechsel gehalten?</p>

<p>Warum soll sie gerade am Abend etwas essen? Waere es nicht sinnvoller morgens eine Kleinigkeit zu essen und am Abend - ganz egal ob gemuetlich zuhause oder unterwegs haelst Du sie vom Essen ab und geniesst es?</p>

<p>Ein neugieriger Ferfred</p>

<p>Hello frogger,</p>

<p>what exactly do you like about the fact that Hanne eats so little? It's probably a mixture of several aspects, but what is most important: Do you just like very thin women? Does it turn you on that she starves for you? Do you enjoy watching her fight her hunger pains? Or do you like to present a slim girlfriend or a girlfriend who is very self-controlled and doesn't have to eat anything in company?</p>

<p>How did she get along with your parents regarding clothes (apart from the bare feet) and food over Christmas and over new year?</p>

<p>Why should she eat something in the evening? Wouldn't it make more sense to eat a little something in the morning and in the evening - regardless of whether you're at home or on tour, you keep her from eating and enjoy the time?</p>

<p>A curious Ferfred</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred, great to hear from you :)</p>

<p>I love when women are hungry and it really excites me to see her ribs and know that she is almost starved. Is very exciting when I know she has not eaten in a very long time. I also like that others can see how thin and good looking she is :)</p>

<p>Hanne gets along well with my parents and my family. But they often ask her if she is freezing and wants to borrow a jacket or a blanket, but Hanne always says no no matter how cold she is. I know she does it to please me :)
During the holidays or when we eat at someone's house, she eats normally, but when we come home again, she usually fasts for a day or two to make up for the "gluttony" as she calls it.</p>

<p>I would prefer that she eats as infrequently as possible, should preferably see that she never eats but understand that she has to.
I therefore think it is better that she only eats once a day instead of eating a little less several times, I also know that she is even hungrier when there is about 24 hours between each time she eats (know it is a bit sadistic of me)</p>

<p>Can't wait for Easter, then only Hanne and I will go on a cabin trip, so then I hope there will be a lot of freezing and smoking and little food :)</p>

<p>Regards,  Frogger</p>

<p>Hi :)</p>

<p>Das ist ja echt ein interessantes "Forum" hier. Ich hab noch nicht alles gelesen, nur so Anfang und Ende dieses Threads, aber dachte, ich melde mich schonmal.</p>

<p>Ich bin Sophie und ich kam hier drauf, weil ich seit Kurzem mit jemandem zusammen bin, bei dem ich das Gefühl habe, dass er es irgendwie mag, mich frieren zu sehen. Und beim Suchen bin ich auf euch hier gestoßen. Wie gesagt, wir sind erst kurz zusammen, aber es gab schon ein paar kleine "Situationen" in der Richtung:</p>

<p>Als wir uns vor ein paar Wochen zum ersten Mal getroffen haben, war es schon recht warm und ich hab ein für die Jahreszeit recht leichtes Top getragen, das auch einen kleinen Streifen Bauch frei lässt. Das hat ihm ganz gut gefallen; er konnte jedenfalls seine Hände nicht bei sich behalten, was mir sehr geschmeichelt hat, haha. Fand ich schon irgendwie toll. Jedenfalls haben wir uns ein paar Tage später wieder getroffen, aber eben abends und da hatte ich eben einen Pullover und eine leichte Jacke an. Naturgemäß habe ich da seine Blicke nicht mehr ganz so extrem auf mich gezogen wie in dem leichten Top. Er hat dann auch gesagt, wie gut ich ihm beim ersten Date gefallen habe und dass er es schade findet, dass ich jetzt so "eingepackt" sei. Ich hab natürlich gesagt, dass es halt super kalt wird abends, aber irgendwie fand er das nicht so überzeugend. "Trotzdem schade. Das Top letztes Mal sah einfach klasse aus und du hast doch nichts zu verstecken." Hab ich natürlich schon ganz gerne gehört, aber wir haben es dann dabei belassen.</p>

<p>Bei unserem nächsten Date hatte es diesen Kälteeinbruch gegeben. Es hat nicht mehr geschneit, aber war schon noch kalt. Wir haben uns zu nem kleinen Spaziergang im Park verabredet und er hat mir vorher geschrieben: "Vielleicht sehe ich ja mein Lieblingstop wieder ;)" Kam natürlich nicht infrage, dass ich nur mit dem Top rausgehe, denn es war echt noch kalt. Aber irgendwie hatte ich schon Lust, ein bisschen mitzuspielen. Also hab ich das Top angezogen und eine Jeansjacke drüber. Es war schon echt kalt draußen, aber mit der Jacke ging es so einigermaßen. Als wir uns trafen, hatte ich die Jacke noch zu und wir sind halt ein bisschen spazieren gegangen. Er hat gar nichts zu der Jacke oder so gesagt, wovon ich ein bisschen enttäuscht war. Also musste ich selbst ran, hab meine Jacke aufgeknöpft und gesagt: "Ich hab übrigens eine kleine Überraschung für dich. Ganz ohne Jacke ist es zwar zu kalt, aber schau, ich hab 'dein' Top an. :)" Er hat sich sichtlich gefreut und gestichelt: "Cool, hätte nicht gedacht, dass du das machst. Aber sieht toll aus!" Er hat dann meine Taille gefasst und wir haben bisschen rumgemacht, sind dann aber weitergegangen. Mit offener Jacke war es schon ordentlich kalt, aber ich hab mir erstmal nichts anmerken lassen. Hab aber schon gemerkt, dass er es genossen hat, ab und zu einen Blick von mir zu erhaschen. Später haben wir noch eine ruhigere Ecke zum Rummachen gefunden und da hat er es auch irgendwie geschafft, mich aus der Jacke rauszumanövrieren. Hab ich zwar mit mir machen lassen, aber hab die Jacke dann zurückgefordert, als wir weiter wollten. Natürlich vergeblich. Er hat gesagt, ich solle doch bisschen die frische Luft genießen. Ich hab mich natürlich empört gegeben, aber es hat mir auch super gefallen, wenn ich ehrlich bin. Es war dann aber schon echt eisig und ich hab auch bald angefangen ein bisschen zu zittern, wollte mir aber nichts anmerken lassen, um ihm nicht die Genugtuung zu geben. Er musste dann aber eh kurz darauf weiter, weil er noch einen Termin hatte, und hat mir meine Jacke dann glücklicherweise wiedergegeben.</p>

<p>Und letztes Wochenende wollten wir abends ins Theater und nachmittags vorher noch ein bisschen in den Park. Vorher waren wir bei mir und ich hab mit ihm überlegt, was ich anziehe. Er hat ein grünes Sommerkleid vorgeschlagen, das er in meinem Schrank entdeckt hatte: "Ist doch super warm heute und ich bin gespannt, wie dir das steht! Du hast noch nie viel Bein gezeigt bisher." Das mit den Beinen stimmt zwar, aber lag halt einfach daran, dass es März/April war und nicht August. Und ein bisschen auch daran, dass ich meine Beine jetzt nicht soooo hundertprozentig mag. Der Wind war zwar eigentlich schon noch recht kalt, aber mit der Sonne wäre das schon gegangen und ich hatte auch Lust darauf! Das hab ich auch so gesagt, aber dann noch bemerkt: "Aber wir kommen ja nicht mehr zurück vor dem Theater und nach dem Theater ist es dann zu kalt." "Ach Quatsch, Sophie. So kalt wird es schon nicht sein und wir können ja zur Not auch mit dem Bus zurück fahren statt zu laufen." "Du willst mich doch nur wieder frieren sehen, haha." "Was heißt frieren. Ich finde einfach, du siehst toll aus und sehe dich halt gerne in süßen Klamotten." Das ging dann noch bisschen hin und her, ich hab ihn ein bisschen damit aufgezogen, wie besessen er anscheinend von mir ist, aber natürlich hab ich mich am Ende breitschlagen lassen ... Im Park haben wir dann eben ein bisschen "rumgelegen" und ein bisschen Frisbee gespielt. Das mit der Frisbee war tatsächlich ziemlich abenteuerlich. Das Kleid ist nämlich echt locker und der Saum ist etwas unter der Mitte der Oberschenkel, aber deutlich über den Knien. Der Wind war natürlich eine Herausforderung und ich hatte auch das Gefühl, dass er mir die Frisbee oft absichtlich etwas hoch zugeworfen hat, sodass ich oft springen musste. War jedenfalls sehr aufregend für mich. Der Wind war zwar wirklich noch ziemlich kühl, aber mit der Bewegung ging es und ansonsten hat er mich gerne gewärmt. :) Später waren wir noch essen und danach eben im Theater. Es war schon davor merklich kühler geworden, aber als wir wieder rauskamen, war es schon deutlich nach Sonnenuntergang und dementsprechend wirklich kalt. Ich hab natürlich direkt gefröstelt und mich bei ihm beklagt, dass ich doch gesagt habe, dass es viel zu kalt ist. Aber er fand die frische Luft anscheinend einladender als ich und wollte dann doch zu mir nach Hause laufen.  "Es ist doch ein so schöner Abend, Sophie. Und ein bisschen Bewegung schadet uns nach dem langen Sitzen sicher auch nicht. Was meinst du? Hältst du durch? Ich finde, du siehst toll aus in deinem Kleidchen!" Ich weiß auch nicht, aber irgendwie konnte ich da nicht widersprechen. Er hat sich so offensichtlich so darauf gefreut und ich wollte ihm die Freude nicht nehmen. Und wenn ich an die Situation und an seine Worte zurückdenke, wird mir immer noch ganz "flau" im Magen. Dieses "Hältst du durch?" und die Komplimente. Das fühlt sich irgendwie so gut an. Irgendwie so verboten?  Jedenfalls sind wir dann nach Hause gelaufen, was ja auch nur zwei oder drei Kilometer sind. Ich musste schon arg zittern, aber hab seine Hand um meine Taille so sehr genossen. Und einmal hat er gesagt: "Schau, du bist die einzige, die noch so flott unterwegs ist. Du bist einfach was Besonderes." Aah, naja. Es war zwar eisig, aber ihr könnt euch vorstellen, dass es umso schöner war, als wir dann zu Hause waren. ;)</p>

<p>Ich weiß, alles nichts so Verrücktes, wie ihr es hier beschreibt, aber für mich ist es schon aufregend (und kalt, haha!) genug. :) Und irgendwie weiß ich nicht, wie ich damit umgehen soll. Ich denke, ich sollte eigentlich empört sein oder so, aber ich fühle mich schon wie was Besonderes dabei und das macht es irgendwie spannend.</p>

<p>Jetzt muss ich aber los. Ich lese die nächsten Tage dann noch ein bisschen hier weiter und bin auch gespannt, was ihr zu meinen kleinen "Abenteuern" sagt. :)</p>

<p>Hallo Frogger,
wie waren Deine Ostertage? Es gibt doch bestimmt etwas Spannendes zu berichten.</p>

<p>Aha, auch geoutet als kleiner Sadist ;-) 
Es scheint so zu sein, das Markus Lisas Kraft, ihren Hunger im Griff zu haben, besonders gerne vorfuehrt, wenn andere dabei sind. Wahrscheinlich soll sie schon den ganzen Tag vorher nichts essen, damit sie besonders schlang aussieht beim Besuch oder bei der Party. Und wenn dann der Moment gekommen ist und das leckere Essen vor ihrer Nase steht, bekommt sie auch nichts. Mir scheint es fast so zu sein, dass Markus das Thema bewusst dann anspricht, wenn Dritte, Freunde, Kellner, dies auch mitbekommen. Martin wird das sicherlich besser bewerten koennen.</p>

<p>Vielleicht kannst Du ja Hanne von einer Saftkur ueberzeugen. Schau z.B. hier: https://www.isshappy.de/der-ultimative-saftkur-guide-teil-2-die-wichtigsten-tipps-fuer-anfaenger/
Da sie ja allgemein schon wenig isst, ist die Gefahr des Jo-jo-Effekts gering. Sie kann dann ja mal schauen, wie lange sie durchhaelt. Leider gehoert dazu auch der Verzicht auf Kaffee und Zigaretten. Der Trick daran ist, dass man die Diaet nicht einfach abbrechen kann, wenn es eine Gelegenheit zum Schlemmen gibt, sondern geplant abgeschlossen werden muss (sonst wuerde sie es bereuen).</p>

<p>Was haeltst du im Sommer eigentlich von zerrissenen Jeans-Hotpants?</p>

<p>Hello frogger,
how were your easter days? There must be something exciting to report.</p>

<p>Aha, also outed as a little sadist ;-)</p>

<p>It seems that Markus enjoys demonstrating Lisa's power to control her hunger when others are around. She probably shouldn't eat anything the whole day before so she looks extra slim when visiting someone or at a party. And when the moment comes and the delicious food is in front of her, she doesn't get anything either. It almost seems to me that Markus consciously addresses the topic when third parties, friends, waiters, also notice it. Martin will certainly be able to rate this better.</p>

<p>Maybe you can convince Hanne to take a juice cleanse. See e.g. here: https://www.isshappy.de/der-ultimative-saftkur-guide-teil-2-die-important-tipps-fuer-anfaenger/
Since she generally eats little, the risk of the yo-yo effect is low. Then you can see how long she can hold out. Unfortunately, this also includes giving up coffee and cigarettes. The trick is that you can't just stop the diet when there's an opportunity to feast, it has to be completed in a planned manner (or else she'd regret it).</p>

<p>What do you think of torn denim hot pants in summer?</p>

<p>Regards
Ferfred</p>

<p>Hallo Sophie,</p>

<p>zunaecht mal herzlich willkommen in dieser Runde.
Deine Erlebnisse sind zwar nicht so verrueckt, wie manch andere Schilderungen hier, aber fuer den Einstieg gar nicht ohne.</p>

<p>Vielleicht magst du dich etwas genauer vorstellen. Vermutlich bist du deutlich juenger als die anderen Damen, von denen hier berichtet wird.</p>

<p>Offensichtlich gibt es genuegend Maenner (eben auch hier im Forum), denen es gefaellt, wenn Frau viel Haut zeigt, auch wenn es dafuer eigentlich zu kalt ist. Und auf der anderen Seite gibt es Frauen, die gerne mitspielen, entweder um ihrem Freund zu gefallen, sich selbst etwas zu beweisen, Maennern gerne den Kopf verdrehen oder einfach zeigen wollen, wie gut sie aussehen.</p>

<p>Ebenso musst du noch genau heraus finden, was deinem Freund eigentlich genau daran gefaellt. Will er nur moeglichst viel von dir sehen, mag er, dich herauszufordern, will er zeigen, was fuer eine tolle Freundin er hat?</p>

<p>Du schreibst, dass du noch nicht so genau weisst, wie du damit umgehen sollst. Welche Fragen stellst du dir genau? Natuerlich ist das ganz ein etwas verruecktes Spiel und du must fuer dich die Regeln dieses Spiels festlegen. </p>

<p>Gruss, Ferfred</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred, </p>

<p>auch wenn es etwas spät ist, möchte ich dir noch antworten:</p>

<p>es hat ja in den letzten zwei Wochen noch mal einen richtigen Kaelteeinbruch bei uns gegeben. Wie hat sich Lisa da geschlagen?</p>

<p>Sie hat sich in dieser  relativ kühlen Zeit tapfer geschlagen, obwohl Marcus keine Gelegenheit ausgelassen hat, sie wie im Hochsommer auszuführen. Ich glaube sie hat mehr gefroren, als an manchen Wintertagen. So hat Marcus in dieser Zeit dafür gesorgt, dass Lisa mit ihm in der Kälte unterwegs war. Ich hatte das Glück ein paar mal dabei sein zu dürfen. So habe ich den beiden ein Paket vorbei gebracht. Als ich bei ihnen klingelte, kamen sie gerade vom Training im See. Lisa umarmte mich zur Begrüßung, ich spürte wie durchgefroren Lisa war, ihre Gänsehaut eiskalt, mit blauen Lippen zitterte sie in meinen Armen. Mir war schon kalt in meinen Winterklamotten, doch wie kalt musste sich Lisa fühlen. Marcus nahm mir das Paket ab und fragte mich, ob ich mit in den Garten komme, dabei tauschte er seine Jacke gegen einen Wintermantel und fragte Lisa, ob sie seine Wollmütze gesehen hat. Lisa war erstaunt, antwortete mit klappernden Zähnen, während ich sie zitternd und hustend vor der Tür im Arm hielt: In den Garten? Jetzt? Marcus: Ja, Martin hat versprochen, mir zu helfen, du kommst doch mit, oder? aber wo ist meine Wollmütze? Lisa: Ich habe sie weggeräumt, dachte doch nicht, dass es nochmal so kalt wird, sie liegt im Schrank. Ich zu Lisa: Kommst du auch mit? Lisa lachte und musste stark husten: Ja, ich kann euch doch nicht allein lassen. Ich fühlte ihre extreme Gänsehaut auf ihrem nackten Ruecken: Schön, dann ziehe dir schnell was über, nur in Gänsehaut ist es heute echt zu kalt, so wie du frierst wird deine Erkältung immer schlimmer, und es wird im Garten sicher länger dauern. Lisa schmiegte sich fest an mich: Bin echt durchgefroren, war so lange im Wasser. Während Marcus im Schrank warme Klamotten suchte rief sie ihm zu: Bringst du mir was mit? Marcus kam in Winterklamotten  gut gelaunt aus der Tür: Hab alles gefunden. Er setzte seine Mütze auf und meinte: Wir können los. Ich: Hast du für Lisa nichts mitgebracht? Er lachte, griff in die Manteltasche und zeigte zwei Schachteln Zigaretten, gab eine davon Lisa:  Für dich mein Schatz. Lisa versuchte mit ihren klammen zitternden Händen die Schachtel zu öffnen, sie fiel ihr aus der Hand, ich bückte mich, konnte meine Blicke nicht von ihren nackten zitternden Beinen lassen, hob die Schachtel auf, zündete ihr eine Zigarette an und redete Marcus ins Gewissen: Wir können Lisa nicht ohne Jacke und barfuß mitnehmen. Marcus nahm Lisa in den Arm, streichelte über ihre zitternden Rippen: Brauchst du eine Jacke? Lisa zog tief an ihrer Zigarette, hustete wieder, konnte dann ihr Zittern kurz unterdrücken, doch ihre Zähne klapperten weiter: Ich brauche wirklich keine Jacke, aber vielleicht meine Flipflops. Marcus ernst: Wenn du möchtest, dann hol sie dir. Lisa lachte: Nein, war nur Spaß, ich weiß doch, dass du sie nicht magst. Lasst uns starten. Marcus nahm sie in den Arm: So mag ich dich. Lisa hat sich tapfer geschlagen, sie bekam zeitweise heftige Zitteranfälle, hatte Mühe ihre Zigarette zu halten, ich musste ihr eine nach der anderen anzünden, ihr Husten wurde immer heftiger, ich habe ihr immer wieder meine Jacke angeboten. Doch Lisa: Nein, ich kann doch im Frühling keine Jacke tragen. Wir waren dann bis zum Abend im Garten und Lisa zitterte kaum noch, sogar Marcus hat ihr jetzt seinen Mantel angeboten. Lisa klammerte sich an Marcus, küsste ihn: Es reicht, wenn du mich zu Hause aufwärmst. Ein anderes mal waren wir gemeinsam zu einer Geburtstagsparty eingeladen. Wir waren zuvor mit meinem kleinen Neffen auf dem Spielplatz, es war vielleicht 4 oder 5 Grad Celsius, dann noch am See, Lisa absolvierte ihre zwei Runden, danach gingen wir zu mir, damit sich Lisa für die Party fertig machen konnte. Ich durfte ihren Rücken eincremen, was ich sehr genoss, ihre Schulterblaetter, ihre Rippen, ihre zitternden Muskeln unter ihrer Gaensehaut zu spüren. In der Wohnung verstärkte sich ihr Zittern noch. Ich sprach sie darauf an, Lisa konnte kaum stehen und sprechen: Oh Gott ist mir kalt. Marcus klingelte und brachte ihre Klamotten, einen geschlitzten Minirock, ein winziges glitzerndes Bandeau und High Heels. Lisa sah umwerfend aus, wir gingen zu Fuß zur Party, es kühlte sich bis in die Nacht immer weiter ab, doch Lisa hielt sich sehr oft auf der Terrasse auf, um mit den begeisterten Männern zu rauchen und erwähnte, dass Marcus ihre Klamotten ausgesucht hat. Einer meinte zu Marcus: man kann doch dieses Top jetzt nicht tragen, es ist viel zu kalt dafür, siehst du nicht, dass Lisa friert und überall Gänsehaut hat. Doch Marcus meinte nur: Ich finde das Top passt super zu Lisa ihrer geilen Gänsehaut. Klar friert Lisa, dass macht ihr nichts aus. </p>

<p>Du hast mal erzaehlt, das Lisa immer quer durch den See schwimmt, damit sie nicht abbrechen kann und durchhalten muss. Ist das immer noch so? Ist das ein oeffentlicher Badesee mit Publikumsverkehr? Wenn Sie dort fast taeglich hingeht, koennte ich mir gut vorstellen, dass sie dort schon eine Fangemeinde hat.</p>

<p>Ja, sie schwimmt quer durch den See, nimmt aber jetzt im eisigen Wasser einen kürzeren Weg, da es sonst zu gefährlich wäre, dafür besteht Marcus oft auf einer zweiten Runde, die Lisa an den Rand ihrer Kräfte bringt. Es ist ein öffentlicher See, aber im Winter nur selten mit Publikum. </p>

<p>Wird  Lisa nur wegen ihrer sommerlichen Kleidung angesprochen oder auch wegen ihrer Figur? Du schreibst ja, dass sie offen darueber redet, dass sie wegen ihrer (fehlenden) Keidung schon stark friert. Spricht sie auch offen darueber, wie stark sie hungert um ihre Figur zu halten?</p>

<p>Meist wird Lisa auf ihre sommerliche Kleidung angesprochen, ob sie nicht friert und ihre Erkaeltung angesprochen, da es ja offensichtlich ist, wie kalt ihr sein muss, wenn ihr ganzer Körper zittert und mit Gänsehaut überzogen ist. Sie bekommt natürlich auch oft Komplimente für ihre Figur, doch ihren starken Hunger sieht man ihr nicht an. Doch auf Fragen, ob sie für ihre schlanke Linie hungert, gibt sie offen zu, dass sie kaum Kalorienreiches isst und ihr Hungergefuehl mit Zigaretten unterdrücken muss. </p>

<p>Meinst Du, sie schafft es nur mit dem vielen Rauchen ihre Diaet zu halten? Icemans Carina scheint es ja auch irgendwie ohne Rauchen zu schaffen. Natuerlich wuerde Lisa am Anfang "Amok laufen", wenn sie weder genuegend essen noch rauchen darf, aber letztlich wuerde es ihr bestimmt gut tun. Und sie ist ja recht hart gegen sich selbst.</p>

<p>Keine Ahnung, ich denke sie zu abhängig, vielleicht wenn Marcus darauf bestehen würde, doch ich habe das Gefühl er unterstützt es beinahe, jedenfalls sagt er nichts mehr dagegen. </p>

<p>Wenn ihr gemeinsam zum Essen geht und Marcus legt ihr nahe doch nichts fuer sich zu bestellen, entweder durch Worte oder durch das Hinlegen der Zigaretten, ist das fuer sie dann schon "normal" geworden oder verraten ihre Augen, Gesten oder Worte doch, dass sie sehr gerne wenigstens eine Kleinigkeit essen wuerde? Kommt die Aufforderung von Marcus eher verdeckt nur an Lisa oder platziert er es bewusst so, dass Kellner und/oder Freunde das mitbekommen?</p>

<p>Lisa lässt schon erkennen, dass sie unglaublich hungrig ist, doch Marcus platziert seine Erwartungen an Lisa bewusst so, dass alle es mitbekommen. Lisa bestellt dann höchstens einen Espresso. </p>

<p>VG Martin </p>

<p>Hallo Sophie, schön von dir zu hören. Deine Erlebnisse erinnern mich sehr an den Anfang der Beziehung zwischen Lisa und meinem Sohn. Auch er ermunterte Lisa immer knappere und dünnere Klamotten zu tragen. Lisa hatte anfangs auch Zweifel, ob sie die Kälte erträgt, dennoch kam sie seinen Wünschen nach, obwohl die Temperaturen immer weiter sanken. Später suchte er die Klamotten für Lisa aus, dabei bedeckte immer weniger Stoff ihre Gänsehaut. Am Anfang zeigte sie sich ungern so in der Öffentlichkeit, doch mittlerweile geniesst sie die bewundernden Blicke. Du hast sicher toll in deinem kleid ausgesehen und dein Freund war sicher stolz, dich so in seinem Arm zu halten. Auch dir hat es ja offensichtlich gefallen, oder? Könntest du dir vorstellen für deinen Freund noch weiter zu gehen, wenn er sich das wünscht? Sicher ist Lisa extrem, doch ich kann mir manchmal nicht vorstellen, wie kalt ihr bereits sein muss, doch Marcus lässt ihr keine Gelegenheit sich aufzuwärmen und stellt sie vor immer neue Herausforderungen.  Ich finde euch faszinierend, wenn ihr Gänsehaut zeigt und euch so verhaltet, als wäre es selbstverständlich. Aber nun wird es erstmal wieder wärmer. </p>

<p>LG Martin </p>

<p>Hi Ferfred :)</p>

<p>We had a very good Easter holiday, we went to the cabin right after Hanne finished work on Wednesday. She had not eaten anything that day, and "naughty" as I am, I ate a big meal before I picked her up at work. So when we got to the cabin I quickly opened some wine so that day there was only smoke and wine on her :)
The next morning we got up quite early to go skiing (cross country) Hanne was only wearing ripped jeans and a cropped top, and she was barefoot in the ski boots, at the beginning of the day the sun was quite warm so she did not freeze then but rather sweaty a little. I told her we were going for a short walk, but I tricked her so we went all day;) When we had gone a few hours we sat down and took a break, she had nothing to sit on so she sat straight in the snow.
I had packed a packed lunch, but only for myself. I tossed a pack of cigarettes to Hanne and said good lunch :) She looked quite startled when she discovered that I had not brought food for her, but she said nothing even though she was obviously very hungry, Instead she smoked 5- 6 cigarettes during the break. She is so sexy when she smokes.
As we went on, the sun was almost gone and it was getting colder. I saw that Hanne started to freeze when we walked, we walked like this for a couple of hours before she started saying she was very cold and that she had very sore feet. I said that we must have gone wrong (I deliberately went the longest route) and that you had a few hours left before we reached the cabin. I asked if she did not want a cigarette where she went, she looked at me strangely but I said it would have been very sexy to see her ski and smoke, so she said yes. And every time she finished smoking, I gave her a new one.
When we got to the cabin she froze a lot, she had big goosebumps and crooked teeth.
When she took off her ski boots, she had large ugly gait wounds on her heels. Barefoot in ski boots is probably not recommended. I fetched a first aid kit so she could clean and patch the wounds, she was still sitting outside while she did it. I hurried to eat while she did this and came out with wine for her, we sat out drinking all evening, Hanne quickly got drunk since she was completely empty in the stomach and do not think she thought that going in was a possibility even if she sat shivering from the cold. It got so cold that I put on a thick jacket and hat, while she sat there barefoot in cropped top and jeans. And tried to warm up on cigarettes.
The next morning I feel a little sorry for her so I made some breakfast for her, I cooked 1 egg for her and 1 slice of toast. We ate this outside and afterwards she lay in the sun wall and sunbathed, she was still wearing the same clothes as the day before. When I saw that she had fallen asleep, I took a bucket of water and threw it over her lol. She jumped up fiercely and ran after me barefoot through the snow she got hold of me and we rolled around playing in the snow. She was drenched in snow and water when we finished, but she did not change clothes but we sat outside smoking and drinking some wine this evening as well. Her gait was so bad that she could not wear shoes so she just had to be barefoot, I saw that her feet were fiery red from the cold and I was very happy about it :) I cooked, and I was a little sadistic towards her when I asked if she might refrain from eating since she had already eaten that day and we were going to have guests the next day for dinner so it was perhaps best that she fasted and rather smoked a little extra. She did not object, but just continued and chain smoke. When we went to bed she was so cold that I started massaging her feet as if they were so icy cold, we kissed and warmed each other (if you know what I mean) before we fell asleep.
The next day a couple of friends came by us and we ate outside in the cold, I had lit a fire and a fire pan and we sat on reindeer skins. Everyone sat dressed except Hanne, she had changed, but sat as usual in cropped top, holey jeans and barefoot. Our friends asked if she was not frozen, but she said no that the fire warmed her, even though the goosebumps on her arms and thighs said otherwise. Our friends are used to seeing Hanne freeze so they said nothing more.
Her chafing has bothered her so much that almost 2 weeks later she still can not wear shoes so she now wears flip-flops, to my great happiness :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips on diet, but a diet where she can not smoke I do not want her on, I only love when she smokes. But after Easter she has kept to one meal a day and she has not eaten until about 20-21, so she goes hungry most of the day :)
But she still has a long way to go before she's at Lisa's level.</p>

<p>Cutoff jeans shorts are nice, but I actually prefer that she wears long jeans, but several of the ones she wears the most are very hollow and show a lot of skin and where the thighs are is just a big hole :)</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon :)</p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hi Martin.
Lisa is a true godess:)
I just love how stared she is and how much she smokes.
Your son is very lucky.
I really hope my girlfriend will reach Lisa's level.</p>

<p>Hi ihr!</p>

<p>Tut mir leid, dass ich so lange gebraucht habe, es war eine stressige Woche und auch ein volles Wochenende. Aber ich hab viel nachgedacht!</p>

<p>Ferfred, klar kann ich kurz was zu mir sagen: Wie du richtig vermutet hast, bin ich noch recht jung, nämlich 19, und studiere jetzt seit im vierten Semester Psychologie (hab also während Corona angefangen ...) und bin dazu in eine WG hier an meinem Studienort gezogen, in der ich jetzt mit zwei anderen Mädels wohne. </p>

<p>Ich habe orange-rote Haare und eine normale bis schlanke, sportliche Figur, würde ich sagen. Apropos Figur: Die scheint euch ja auch super wichtig zu sein. Ich wollte darauf im letzten Beitrag schon eingehen, aber der war dann schon lang genug. Jedenfalls achtet mein Freund ja schon auch auf meine Figur und mir ist schon deutlich aufgefallen, dass er es gerne schlank mag. Z. B. habe ich ihm einmal gesagt, dass ich seine starken Arme mag und er hat daraufhin seine Hand auf meinen Bauch gelegt, gelächelt und erwidert: "Ich mag deinen flachen Bauch." Uff! Klar hat mir das geschmeichelt, aber ich hab mich auch ein bisschen unter Druck gesetzt gefühlt. "Gar kein Druck oder so, haha", hab ich dann geantwortet.</p>

<p>Oder ein anderes Mal ging es darum, wie wir jeweils vegan geworden sind (bin ich seit nicht ganz einem Jahr, er schon ne Weile länger; er ist ja auch schon 25), und er hat mich gefragt, ob ich auch erstmal ein paar Kilogramm abgenommen hätte, denn ihm war das anscheinend so gegangen. Ich hab ihm dann erzählt, wie es bei mir war: Tatsächlich habe ich auch etwa 3 kg abgenommen, und war dieselben 3 kg, die ich seit meinem Auszug von zu Hause zugelegt hatte. Corona und die Kochkünste meiner einen Mitbewohnerin haben da leider am Anfang Spuren hinterlassen. Seit ich vegan esse, koche ich fast immer selbst und achte halt darauf, dass es gesund ist. Muss ich auch, denn "von Natur aus" (wenn es das überhaupt gibt) bin ich nicht die Dünnste, womit ich als Kind und als Jugendliche auch ziemlich unzufrieden war, bis ich dann in den letzten zwei Schuljahren mehr auf meine Ernährung geachtet und von 65 auf 54 kg abgenommen habe. Bei 1,73 m übrigens.</p>

<p>Das habe ich ihm jedenfalls dann erzählt und er schien positiv beeindruckt: "Wow, nicht schlecht! Ich dachte, du wärst einfach natürlich so schön schlank, aber dann Respekt! Bist du jetzt mit den 54 kg wieder zufrieden?" Keine Ahnung, was ich da sagen soll. "Ja, schon. Ist okay", habe ich gesagt.</p>

<p>Worin liegen meine Bedenken, fragst du, Ferfred. In mehreren Dingen eigentlich. Zum einen kann das ja nicht so gesund sein, dauernd zu frieren, und so zu hungern wie Martins Lisa z. B. geht auf Dauer bestimmt auf die eine oder andere Weise schief. Aber das verlangt ja auch niemand von mir!</p>

<p>Vor allem laufen diese Fixierung auf mein Äußeres und dieser Wunsch, mir vorschreiben zu wollen, was ich trage, eigentlich komplett gegen das, wie ich mir eine Beziehung immer vorgestellt habe. Der Mann sollte mich ja nicht (oder nicht hauptsächlich) für mein Äußeres lieben und mir außerdem die Freiheit lassen, zu tragen, was ich will. Und dass er mich gerne frieren lässt, ist eigentlich geradezu toxisch!</p>

<p>Aber trotzdem fühlt es sich mega gut an! Ich liebe seine Komplimente, seine Aufmerksamkeit. Ich liebe es, was Besonderes zu sein und auch die Blicke der anderen (Passanten, etc.) Vielleicht liebe ich es auch deshalb, weil ich es eigentlich verabscheuen sollte, weil es eben so verboten ist. So ähnlich ging es mir auch damals, als ich während der Schulzeit abgenommen habe: Für mich war das genau richtig und ich habe mich immer wohler in meiner Haut gefühlt, aber viele Freundinnen und v. a. meine Mutter und Tanten waren super besorgt und haben immer gesagt, ich solle doch mehr essen oder auch einen Kuchen nehmen, bla, bla, bla. Es ist ja nicht einmal so, dass ich extrem dünn geworden wäre; einfach ein bisschen schlanker eben ... Da hab ich schon gemerkt, was mir gerade auch wieder bewusst wird: Sobald man sich anders verhält, wird man skeptisch beäugt, aber nur so kann man dem Mittelmaß entkommen. Man muss gerade das tun, was die "normalen Leute" nie erwägen würden.</p>

<p>Ich weiß noch nicht ganz genau, was das jetzt für mich heißt, aber auf jeden Fall habe ich Lust, mich ein bisschen herauszufordern. Seit ich letztes Mal geschrieben habe, habe ich meinen Freund zwar nicht gesehen (Ich habe ihm gesagt, dass ich etwas Zeit zum Nachdenken brauche.), aber hab trotzdem leichtere Kleider getragen, als ich es normalerweise bei dem Wetter tun würde. Wenn die Sonne mittags rauskommt, ist es zwar schon schön warm, aber sobald sie weg ist und der Wind weht, muss ich gerade in meinen Tops schon noch frieren. Vor allem wenn ich morgens in die Uni fahre, ist es echt noch kalt.</p>

<p>Ich hab auch in den letzten Tagen schon mal meine kurzen Hosen rausgeholt. War zwar auch cool, da die einzige in der Uni zu sein, die die jetzt schon trägt, aber hab halt wieder gemerkt, dass ich mit meinen Beinen noch nicht so zufrieden bin. Da muss ich auf jeden Fall noch was machen. Heute Vormittag beim Brunchen bei Freundinnen war ich aber schon brav und hab nur ein bisschen Salat gegessen :)</p>

<p>Mist, jetzt wird mir die Zeit doch wieder knapp, weil ich gleich zum Tanzkurs muss, aber ich wollte noch ein bisschen was zu Lisa fragen, Martin. Sie scheint ja echt auf Dauerdiät zu sein. Isst sie da nicht viel zu wenig, sodass sie auf Dauer total abmagert? Es klingt ja gerade so, dass sie quasi nie eine normale Mahlzeit isst. Wenn sie allein ist, isst sie vermutlich ein kleines bisschen mehr, als wenn sie mit Markus irgendwo hingeht oder? Und sie geht ja immer im See schwimmen. Ist das alles, was sie an Sport macht oder macht sie auch Krafttraining? Ich mache immer Workouts zu Hause oder jogge zum Park und mache da welche. Ich will ja schon auch fit sein und nicht nur dünn.</p>

<p>Jetzt muss ich aber echt los. Lieben Gruß an euch!</p>

<p>Hallo Martin,</p>

<p>ich frage mich manchmal, ob sich Lisa schon damit abgefunden hat, keine warme Kleidung oder etwas zu Essen zu bekommen, wenn sie mit Marcus unterwegs ist. Z.B. als ihr nach ihrem Schwimmtraining in den Garten gegangen seid und Marcus sich passende Kleidung herausgesucht hat. Hatte sie darauf gehofft, auch etwas waermendes mitgebracht zu bekommen? Oder als er ihr Flip-Flops oder spaeter einen Mantel angeboten hat: Wollte er Lisa nur herausfordern oder war es fuersorglich gemeint? Oder geniesst es Lisa vielleicht sogar, noch mal eins oben drauf zu legen, wenn alle anderen eigentlich schon der Meinung sind, dass sie schon extrem tapfer war?</p>

<p>Gehe ich recht in der Annahme, dass sie bei beiden berichteten Erlebnissen (Garten, Party) solange du dabei warst, keinen Bissen zu essen bekommen hat ... und wahrscheinlich den ganzen Tag noch nichts?</p>

<p>Das Partyoutfit war ja richtig scharf. Seid wann steht Marcus auf HighHeels? Waren sie eher gemaessigt oder er 10cm-Versionen? Ich stelle mir das extrem anstrengend vor, auf solchen Schuhen zu laufen, wenn einem die Beine auch noch schlottern. Wie hoch war der Rock denn geschlitzt ;-)</p>

<p>Lieber Gruss
Ferfred</p>

<p>Hallo Sophie,</p>

<p>Du erwartest ja vermutlich auf diesem Forum keine ausgewogene, rein sachliche Bewertung. Eine gewisse Vorpraegung ist also zu erwarten ;-)</p>

<p>Wie du richtig bemerkt hast, gibt es eine starke Verzahnung zwischen Kleidungsstil, Figur und der Bereitschaft zu frieren. Und das auch noch auf verschiedenen Ebenen. Und bei jedem Liebhaber ist das eine oder das andere mehr ausgepraegt. </p>

<p>Eine Kette ist offensichtlich: Wenn frau oder zugehoeriger Mann es mag, dass sie durch besonders sexy Kleidung heraussticht, dann ist das halt nur sexy, wenn die Figur dazu passt. Auf der anderen Seite kann sexy (oft zu lesen als "wenig" oder "duenne" Kleidung) halt dazu fuehren, dass sie in einigen Situationen ins Frieren kommt. Und offensichtlich faellt sexy Kleidung halt besonders dann auf, wenn alle anderen nicht so gekleidet sind etc. pp. Andere stehen vielleicht auf das Frieren an sich und den kalten Koerper - die "Spiele" werden aber ziemlich im Verborgenen ausgelebt. Das wurde hier schon mal irgendwo als eine Art "Gaensehaut-Fetisch" bezeichnet. </p>

<p>Andere Frauen wiederum gefaellt es, ihren Durchhaltewillen unter Beweis zu stellen vor anderen (bzw. den zugehoerigen Maennern zu zeigen, dass sie Freundinnen haben, die das durchhalten), egal ob Kaelte oder Hunger. Das kann dann noch kombiniert werden mit Barfussgehen, HighHeels in unpassenden Situationen oder anderen "Gaengeleien". Dazu wuerde auch uebermaessiges Training oder so gehoeren.</p>

<p>Ebenso klar ist, dass duennere Menschen tendenziell eher frieren als gut gepolsterte, und man kann halt die einzelnen Muskeln viel besser beobachten.</p>

<p>Diese Gedankengeaenge kannst Du jetzt sicherlich selbst in alle Richtungen weiterspinnen und herausfinden, wo bei deinem neuen Freund die Vorlieben liegen.</p>

<p>Jetzt zurueck zu Dir.</p>

<p>Deine Bedenken, was die Fixierung auf das Aeussere angeht, kann ich gut nachvollziehen. </p>

<p>Hierzu zwei Gedanken aus voellig verschiedenen Richtungen: </p>

<p>Vielleicht mag er dich wirklich, steht aber auf einen gewissen Frauentyp / Kleidung / Verhalten. Dann ist es eigentlich nur sehr fair, dir das von vornherein zu sagen und mit offenen Karten zu spielen.</p>

<p>Auf der anderen Seite bist Du ja selbst nicht auf den Kopf gefallen. Du hast ziemlich schnell erkannt, was laeuft, und machst Dir jetzt Gedanken, was DU willst. Du scheinst auch ein gesundes Selbstbild von Dir zu haben. Also bei 1,73 m und 65 kg warst Du nicht die schlankste, aber bist auch noch nicht durch die Gegend gerollt. Jetzt mit 54 kg fuehlst du dich zufrieden, "normal bis schlank" - obwohl es schlank wohl eher treffen wuerde. Die meisten Maenner faenden das top! Wenn du dich an der Uni umschaust, wirst du auch dort zu den schlankeren gehoeren, aber vermutlich wird es noch einige geben, die eine vergleichbare Figur haben.</p>

<p>Und nu?</p>

<p>Irgendwie scheint es dich doch verdammt zu reizen, hier mitzuspielen.</p>

<p>Was genau dich am meisten reitzt, habe ich noch nicht herausgefunden:</p>

<p>Findest Du deinen neuen Freund einfach umwerfend toll?</p>

<p>Gefallen dir seine Schmeicheleien, seine Aufmerksamkeit?</p>

<p>Oder machen die auch die Reaktionen der Beobachter an? Moechtest du "herausstechen" (Zitat: '... aber nur so kann man dem Mittelmass entkommen. Man muss gerade das tun, was die "normalen Leute" nie erwaegen wuerden.')</p>

<p>Oder gefaellt es dir, dich selbst herauszufordern oder herausgefordert zu werden?</p>

<p>Du hast ja schon in den letzten Tagen etwas mit dem Feuer gespielt auch ohne deinen Freund. Was hast Du da fuer Erfahrungen, Eindruecke gesammelt - auch wenn das nicht den Stories von Lisa nahkommt?</p>

<p>Lass dich doch einfach auf das Abenteuer ein. Du hast dann immer noch die Moeglichkeit, klare Grenzen aufzuweisen, oder die Beziehung zu beenden. Du merkst z.B. sehr schnell, ob er dich auch in anderen Belangen kontrollieren will, die hier nicht zum Thema gehoeren. Oder wenn Du z.B. eine Auszeit verlangst, weil Du dich auf wichtige Pruefungen vorbereitest, in denen die Spiele halt nicht so ausgepraegt laufen koennen und er keinerlei Verstaendnis zeigt.</p>

<p>Fordere ihn doch heraus: Du spielst mit - wenn er ein charmanter, gewitzter, einfallsreicher Spielleiter ist. So "darf" er dich zwar anleiten - aber du entscheidest immer noch, ob du mitspielst.</p>

<p>Viel Spass</p>

<p>Hello! I am Hans from Sweden and this is my first time posting on this site. I stumbled across some of the stories here and thought I'd contribute my own.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't like the cold but I sure do have a thing for girls who do. Luckily I am blessed with having a cousin who lives in finland. She is somewhere between 19 and 22 years old, but she and her family still visit us regularly. We own a stuga, a little cottage in the forest with a sauna right next to a little lake. Here we meet a few times a year, when on holiday. </p>

<p>Now I know finnish people being immune to the cold is a bit of a stereotype, but in my cousins case it is absolutely true. The stories I could tell you of her, you wouldn't even believe. As kids already we used to play in the snow after sauna, wearing only our bathing robes or towels. I, of course, wore shoes as well because that snow was freaking cold, but she was barefoot just as often as not.</p>

<p>Nowadays she sadly rarely goes barefoot in the snow anymore, but I also can't remember the last time I saw her wearing a jacket. On one occasion she wore a crop top hoodie in midwinter with around -15C. I could see she had goosebumps but otherwise she seemed unaffected by the cold. She also likes to sit on the pier reading books after sauna, still in her towel, even in winter.</p>

<p>Most notable however, is what happened last year when they visited.
It was autumn with a bit of snow on the ground, but it wasn't overly cold, just around freezing. We had planned to go on a walk together, down to a nearby river, but somehow my cousin forgot about it. Instead she had already gone to the sauna and I think she was reading her book again on the pier. We only realized this as we were already about to leave. We offered to wait until she got dressed but instead she opted to just go as she was, wearing nothing but a towel and a pair of crocs.</p>

<p>I think she must have misjudged the temperature, just having been in the sauna, and was now regretting it but was too proud to say so. After a few hunder meters I could already see her goosebumps. My dad offered her his jacket at least fifteen times, but she kept refusing. After like half an hour it started snowing. We were all fine since we had jackets, but she seemed to be getting colder and colder. Now she was clearly trying to resist shivering as there was snow gathering in her hair. She was still refusing to borrow anyone's jacket.</p>

<p>When we reached the river we saw that it was frozen over. I made a joke about walking across but she seemed to take it as a challenge. We all tried to talk her out of trying it, seeing as it was very dangerous, but she kept insisting. She argued that she was already only wearing a towel, so it wouldn't matter if she got wet. Of course she eventually went for it, and of course she broke through the ice. Her head went under the water for a second but then came right back up again. She manged to pull herself back onto the ice, but was now completely drenched. She had also lost her crocs and was now barefoot.</p>

<p>We hurried back to the stuga but it was still a bit of a walk. She was now shivering badly, and the wet towel made it worse. But since she still refused to borrow a jacket it was either wear a wet towel or nothing at all. There were other cottages along the way, so the second one wasn't really an option. It was also snowing heavier now and there was fresh snow up to her ankles on the road. I walked behind her so that I could look at her feet which were now a dark pink and covered with snow.</p>

<p>As we arrived back at the stuga she was no longer hiding the fact that she was very cold. Her teeth were chattering loudly and I think she had hypothermia. She could not open the door of the sauna herself and I had to help her get in. In the end it was a wonder that she didn't have more frostbite, only a tiny patch on the sole of her left foot that healed within a few days. She stayed in the sauna for over an hour, but in the end she seemed totally fine, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>I hope you found my story interesting. We are going back to the stuga in a week and at this time of year there should still be plenty snow there, so let's hope I come back with some more interesting stories to tell.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope my english wasn't too bad. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!</p>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>

<p>Great story!
Nice to hear from a fellow Scandinavian:)
How does your nice dress like on a normal winter  day? 
Does she also eat rather little like my GF and Lisa?</p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>since there are some people here who write in English, it would probably make sense to continue the thread in English? To be honest, I think I can write faster in German, so I will continue in German, but I'll post an auto-translation below.</p>

<p>Nein, Ferfred, eine ausgewogene Bewertung erwarte ich von euch natürlich nicht. Wenn ich nicht auf ein bisschen Ermutigung und den einen oder anderen Tipp aus wäre, wäre ich nicht hier ;)</p>

<p>Und auch eine schöne Analyse der verschiedenen Motive, Ferfred. Ich muss sagen, dass mir am Frieren selbst eigentlich nichts liegt; es ist schon sehr unangenehm. Und Gänsehaut finde ich jetzt auch nicht besonders sexy. ich denke, ich will einfach ein bisschen herausstechen und in allem besser/sexier sein als die anderen Mädels um mich herum.</p>

<p>Dafür muss ich aber noch ein bisschen was tun, haha. Klar, ich gehöre schon auch eher zu den schlankeren, aber es gibt bei mir im Studiengang tatsächlich einige wunderschöne Mädels, nicht wenige auch schlanker als ich. Aber bei sich selbst ist man ja sowieso immer noch etwas kritischer.  Eine fällt mir da aber direkt ein, die ich oft in der Bibliothek sehe. Sie hat eine atemberaubende Figur: schlank wie ein Model und tolle, drahtige Arme und Beine. Sie war letzten Sommer oft in leichten Sommerkleidern da und ich konnte kaum wegsehen. Es gibt also durchaus Konkurrenz!</p>

<p>Was bringt mich dazu, bei der Sache "mitzuspielen"? Ich denke, mir geht es vor allem um mich selbst dabei und nur in zweiter Linie um Jakob (so nenne ich ihn hier jetzt). Mich reizt die Aufmerksamkeit, die Bewunderung und ja ' definitiv auch die Herausforderung!</p>

<p>Am Sonntagabend habe ich ihm dann noch geschrieben und gefragt, ob er mich zum Essen ausführen will, was wir dann ein paar Tage später auch machten. Ich hatte mich natürlich in Schale geworfen: Ein recht kurzes und ärmelloses blaues Kleid und schöne hohe Stiletto-Pumps, die ich während meiner Abizeit zum Ausgehen ab und zu getragen habe und seither lange nicht mehr. So hat er mich dann abgeholt und wir sind zu Fuß zu dem Restaurant gegangen. Er hat sich natürlich über das Outfit gefreut und mir die gebührenden Komplimente gemacht, aber mehr auch nicht. Die Sonne war auch noch da und es war recht warm.</p>

<p>Im Restaurant ließ ich ihn als ersten bestellen und lächelte dann: "Für mich nur ein Wasser bitte." Jakob sah erstaunt aus und fragte, als der Kellner weg war: "Ich dachte, du wolltest hier essen? Hast du keinen Hunger?"</p>

<p>Ich schaute ihm in die Augen und antwortete: "Schon ein bisschen, aber du magst mich doch schlank oder? Und wenn ich immer so kurze Kleidchen tragen soll, muss ich noch ein bisschen an meiner Figur arbeiten oder?"</p>

<p>Sein Staunen wurde noch größer. "Wow, Sophie ... Ich finde, du siehst echt schon toll aus. Habe ich doch schon oft gesagt."</p>

<p>"Naja, aber du sagst immer, dass du magst, wie schlank ich bin, und meinen flachen Bauch und so weiter. Sei ruhig ehrlich, das ist jetzt wirklich keine Falle: Ein bisschen Speck habe ich ja schon noch am Bauch und an den Schenkeln. Oder hier am Arm." Ich fasste etwas Armspeck zwischen die Finger. "Ohne den würde ich dir doh bestimmt noch besser gefallen oder? Soll ich nicht noch ein wenig abnehmen?" Er antwortete nicht direkt, sodass ich die Achseln zuckte und schnell hinterherschob: "Ich kann's aber auch lassen."</p>

<p>Dann hat er wohl langsam geschalten: "Wow, das habe ich jetzt echt nicht kommen sehen. Okay, ganz ehrlich: Ja, du siehst schon toll aus, aber noch schlanker wäre natürlich noch heißer. Hab mir das ab und zu schon gedacht, wenn ich ehrlich bin. Aber nach der kleinen Auszeit letzte Woche war ich unsicher, ob ich vielleicht zu viel über deine Figur und so rede. D. h., das stört dich nicht?"</p>

<p>"War schon neu für mich und ich musste erst herausfinden, wie ich das finde. Danke für deine Geduld letzte Woche. Ich habe mich jedenfalls entschieden: Ich find's gut! Ich will perfekt für dich sein!  Und du darfst mich gerne ein bisschen herausfordern." Ich grinste schelmisch.</p>

<p>"Soso", sagte er. "Ein bisschen herausfordern also. Das klingt auf jeden Fall interessant." Jetzt war er es, der schelmisch grinste. "Da bin ich ja mal gespannt, was deine Garderobe alles so hergeben wird."</p>

<p>Beim Essen fragte er mich dann zwei Mal, ob ich sicher sei, dass ich nichts wolle. Ich könne einen Bissen abhaben. Aber sein Blick und die beiläufige Art der Fragen hat gezeigt, dass das Angebot nicht dazu gedacht war, angenommen zu werden. "Ne, ne, ich werde nicht weich", antwortete ich pflichtbewusst. Hunger hatte ich zwar schon, aber es fiel mir mit ihm dort sehr leicht, Nein zu sagen. Für ihn, aber vor allem aus Stolz gegenüber mir selbst. Zu allem Überfluss hat er dann auch noch einen Nachtisch gegessen ...</p>

<p>Wie ich mir schon gedacht hatte, wollte er nach dem Essen noch gar nicht nach Hause, sondern noch spazieren gehen. Die Sonne war weg und es war durchaus kühl, aber jetzt nicht unerträglich. Das Kopfsteinpflaster der Altstadt machte mir mehr zu schaffen, was er auch bemerkte: "Schöne Schuhe übrigens, Sophie. Machen schöne, lange Beine. Aber scheint nicht ganz einfach, darin zu laufen oder?"</p>

<p>Ich fühlte mich etwas ertappt: "Haha, ja. Ich trage eigentlich fast nie so hohe Schuhe. Magst du High Heels?"</p>

<p>"Ja, auf jeden Fall. Macht was her."</p>

<p>Manchmal muss man ihm alles aus der Nase ziehen: "Was gefällt dir daran?"</p>

<p>"Hab ich ja eben gesagt: Macht schöne, schlanke Beine. Und zeigt auch, dass sie auf ihre Erscheinung achtet und nicht nur auf Komfort." </p>

<p>Erscheinung über Komfort, ja darauf muss ich mich wohl jetzt einstellen. Ich lachte und sagte mit einem Zwinkern: "Okay, ist notiert."</p>

<p>Wir spazierten dann eine Weile durch die Stadt und redeten über alles Mögliche. Irgendwann hatte er unsere Schritte zu einer Brücke geleitet und wir hielten mitten darauf an und überblickten den Fluss. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war ich langsam echt ausgekühlt und der kalte Wind auf der Brücke tat sein Übriges: Ich war ziemlich am Zittern. Er strich über meine von Gänsehaut überzogenen Arme und fragte auch noch frech: "Ist dir kalt, Sophie?"</p>

<p>"Hmm, vielleicht ein bisschen?"</p>

<p>"Und wie fühlt sich das an?"</p>

<p>"Fühlt sich gut an", log ich, streckte die Arme über meinen Kopf und fragte: "Gefällt's dir?"</p>

<p>"Sehr sexy, Sophie", raunte er und erkundete mit den Händen meinen Körper. Da standen wir dann eine Weile und sind über uns hergefallen. Ich schlotterte zwar in seinen Armen, aber der Moment fühlte sich insgesamt unglaublich gut an."</p>

<p>Vielleicht ist das eine gute Stelle, um mal über ihn etwas mehr zu erzählen, denn er gefällt mir echt gut. (Ansonsten würde ich mir auch nicht gefallen lassen, wie "frech" er manchmal ist.) Er ist aufgeschlossen, selbstbewusst, gebildet, sodass man mit ihm über quasi jedes Thema sinnvoll reden kann, weil er immer interessante Sachen zu sagen hat. Äußerlich ist er einen Kopf größer als ich und auch super durchtrainiert. (Auch hier: Wenn er das nicht wäre, würde ich mir von ihm nichts zu meiner Figur anhören.) Nicht in einer aufgepumpten, sondern eher in einer sehr athletischen Variante, was mir auch besser gefällt. Ich verstehe schon auch, dass er seine Freundin gerne ein bisschen zeigt: Ich genieße es nämlich auch, mit ihm gesehen zu werden und kann mir vorstellen, dass viele Mädels gerne mit mir tauschen würden. Das hat den Moment auf der Brücke noch besser gemacht.  Einige Mädels und Frauen, die vorbeigegangen sind, haben mir schmutzige Blicke zugeworfen, andere eher neidische, die auch mehr auf ihn als auf mich fielen.</p>

<p>Schließlich sind wir dann aber nach Hause gegangen. Als wir dort waren, war ich heilsfroh, endlich die Schuhe ausziehen zu können, denn meine Füße brachten mich fast um. Die Erleichterung habe ich mir aber nicht anmerken lassen. ;)</p>

<p>Später im Bett hat er wieder mal ausgiebig meinen Körper erkundet. Er hat dabei eine Art, mit seinen Händen darüber zu streichen, die sich für mich zwar sanft und schön, aber auch immer auf eine gewisse Weise prüfend anfühlt: Seine Finger verfolgen die Schlüsselbeine, streichen betont langsam und aufmerksam über die Rippen, rasten etwas auf den Hüftknochen. An der Taille fasst er mich gerne mit beiden Händen. An den Innenseite der Oberschenkel streicht sein Daumen deutlich über den dortigen, mir so verhassten Speck. Das hatte er in dieser Art schon immer ein wenig so gemacht, aber nie so deutlich und unapologetisch wie in dieser Nacht. Zu allem Überfluss schaute er mir in die Augen und fragte mich, wie ich eigentlich vorhabe abzunehmen.</p>

<p>Darüber mache ich mir natürlich viele Gedanken: Ich ernähre mich ja sowieso schon ziemlich gesund, um meine jetzige Figur zu halten, und die grundsätzliche Ernährung will ich auch beibehalten: Weiterhin viel Gemüse, Hülsenfrüchte, Samen, Nüsse und Vollkorn. Ich habe aber begonnen, meine Portionen zu verkleinern und v. a. die Kohlenhydrate zu reduzieren. Meine morgendliche Portion Haferflocken mit Obst besteht jetzt v. a. aus Obst und bei Reis, Hirse und solchen Beilagen beschränke ich mich auf ein paar Löffel. Nachmittags habe ich bisher ab und zu im Unicafé mit Kommilitoninnen einen Kuchen gegessen. Solche Sachen und ähnliche Snacks kann ich mir natürlich nicht mehr leisten.</p>

<p>Das habe ich ihm dann auch so erzählt und es war nicht schwierig, weil ich das Thema ja zurzeit dauernd wälze. Aber die Situation war dennoch unangenehm für mich, weil ich eben nackt vor ihm lag und er mich eben so genau sah und spürte. Ich habe mich so verwundbar und unter Druck gesetzt gefühlt. Es war aber auch genau, was ich eigentlich will: Eine Herausforderung. In Zukunft soll ihm kein einziger kritischer Gedanke mehr kommen, wenn er mich anschaut. Das wird zwar wahrscheinlich echt schwierig, aber es ist eine Motivation!</p>

<p>Ich könnte noch mehr schreiben, denn die eine oder andere kleine Nebensächlichkeit habe ich noch erlebt. Aber jetzt muss es erstmal reichen.</p>

<p>Liebe Grüße und bis bald
eure Sophie</p>

<p>[Machine translation of what I posted above. I scanned it and it looks fine overall.]</p>

<p>No, Ferfred, of course I don't expect a balanced evaluation from you. If I wasn't looking for a little encouragement and a tip or two, I wouldn't be here ;)</p>

<p>And also a nice analysis of the different motifs, Ferfred. I have to say that I don't really care for the freezing itself; it's already very uncomfortable. And goosebumps I find now also not particularly sexy. I think I just want to stand out a bit and be better/sexier in everything than the other girls around me.</p>

<p>But for that I still have to do a little bit, haha. Sure, I belong to the slimmer ones, but there are actually some beautiful girls in my study group, quite a few slimmer than me. But with yourself, you're always a little more critical anyway.  But there is one girl I can think of right away, whom I often see in the library. She has a breathtaking figure: slim like a model and great, wiry arms and legs. She was often there last summer in light summer dresses and I could hardly look away. So there is definitely competition!</p>

<p>What makes me want to "play along" with this? I think I'm mainly interested in myself and only secondarily in Jakob (that's what I call him here now). I am attracted by the attention, the admiration and yes - definitely also the challenge!</p>

<p>On Sunday evening I wrote to him and asked if he wanted to take me out to dinner, which we did a few days later. I had dressed up, of course: A rather short and sleeveless blue dress and beautiful high stiletto pumps, which I wore during my high school graduation time to go out now and then and since then not for a long time. So he then picked me up and we walked to the restaurant. He was happy about the outfit, of course, and gave me the compliments I deserved, but that's about it. The sun was also still there and it was quite warm.</p>

<p>At the restaurant, I let him order first and then smiled, "Just a water for me please." Jacob looked surprised and asked when the waiter was gone, "I thought you were going to eat here? Aren't you hungry?"</p>

<p>I looked him in the eye and replied, "I am a little, but you like me slim don't you? And if I'm going to wear such short little dresses all the time, I'm going to have to work on my figure a bit, aren't I?"</p>

<p>His amazement grew even greater. "Wow, Sophie ... I think you look really great already. I've said so many times before."</p>

<p>"Well, but you always say you like how slim I am, and my flat stomach and all. Be honest, it's really not a trap: I still have a bit of flab on my stomach and thighs. Or here on my arm." I grabbed some arm fat between my fingers. "You'd probably like me even better without it, wouldn't you? Don't you want me to lose a little more weight?" He didn't answer directly, so I shrugged and quickly followed up with, "I can leave it off, though."</p>

<p>Then I guess he slowly shifted gears, "Wow, I really didn't see that coming. Okay, honestly, yes, you already look great, but even slimmer would be even hotter, of course. I've thought that from time to time, if I'm honest. But after the little time out last week, I was unsure if maybe I talk too much about your figure and stuff. I.e., that doesn't bother you?"</p>

<p>"Was already new to me and I had to figure out how I felt about it. Thanks for your patience last week. Anyway, I've made up my mind: I like it! I want to be perfect for you!  And you're welcome to challenge me a little." I grinned mischievously.</p>

<p>"So-so," he said. "A little challenging, then. That certainly sounds interesting." Now it was he who was grinning mischievously. "I can't wait to see what your wardrobe comes up with."</p>

<p>Then, at dinner, he asked me twice if I was sure I didn't want anything. I could have a bite. But the look on his face and the casual nature of the questions showed that the offer wasn't meant to be taken. "Nah, nah, I'm not going soft," I dutifully replied. Hungry I was, but it was very easy for me to say no with him there. For him, but mostly out of pride towards myself. To make matters worse, he then ate a dessert ....</p>

<p>As I had already thought, he did not want to go home after dinner, but still go for a walk. The sun was gone and it was quite cool, but now not unbearable. The cobblestones of the old town gave me more trouble, which he also noticed: "Nice shoes, by the way, Sophie. Make nice, long legs. But doesn't seem very easy to walk in, does it?"</p>

<p>I felt a little caught, "Haha, yeah. I actually almost never wear shoes that high. Do you like high heels?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, definitely. Makes you look good."</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to pull it all out of his nose, "What do you like about it?"</p>

<p>"I just told you: makes nice, slim legs. And also shows that she pays attention to her appearance and not just comfort." </p>

<p>Appearance over comfort, yeah I guess I'll have to adjust to that now. I laughed and said with a wink, "Okay, it's noted."</p>

<p>We then walked around town for a while, talking about all sorts of things. At some point he had directed our steps to a bridge and we stopped in the middle of it overlooking the river. At this point I was starting to get really chilled out and the cold wind on the bridge did the rest: I was pretty much shivering. He stroked my goosebump-covered arms and also cheekily asked, "Are you cold, Sophie?"</p>

<p>"Hmm, maybe a little?"</p>

<p>"And how does that feel?"</p>

<p>"Feels good," I lied, stretching my arms above my head, "Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Very sexy, Sophie," he murmured, exploring my body with his hands. There we stood for a while, falling all over each other. I was shaking in his arms, but the moment felt incredibly good overall."</p>

<p>Maybe that's a good place to say a little more about him, because I really like him. (Otherwise, I wouldn't put up with how "sassy" he is sometimes either). He's open-minded, self-confident, educated, so you can talk to him about virtually any topic in a meaningful way, because he always has interesting things to say. Externally, he's a head taller than me and also super well-toned. (Again: If he wasn't, I wouldn't listen to anything he had to say about my figure). Not in a pumped up way, but rather in a very athletic way, which I also like better. I already also understand that he likes to show his girlfriend a bit: After all, I also enjoy being seen with him and can imagine that many girls would love to swap places with me. It made the moment on the bridge even better.  Some girls and women who passed by gave me dirty looks, others rather envious ones, which also fell more on him than on me.</p>

<p>Finally, however, we went home. When we were there, I was happy to finally be able to take off my shoes, because my feet were almost killing me. I didn't let the relief show, though. ;)</p>

<p>Later in bed, he once again extensively explored my body. He has a way of stroking it with his hands that feels gentle and beautiful to me, but also always testing in a certain way: His fingers trace the collarbones, stroking emphatically slowly and attentively over the ribs, resting a bit on the hip bones. At the waist, he likes to grab me with both hands. On the inner thighs, his thumb strokes clearly over the flab there that I hate so much. He had always done this a bit in this way, but never as clearly and unapologetically as on this night. To top it all off, he looked me in the eye and asked me how I actually planned to lose weight.</p>

<p>I worry about that a lot, of course: I eat pretty healthy anyway to keep my current figure, and I want to keep the basic diet: Continue to eat lots of vegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts and whole grains. However, I have started to reduce my portions and especially the carbohydrates. My morning portion of oatmeal with fruit now consists mainly of fruit, and with rice, millet and such side dishes I limit myself to a few spoonfuls. In the afternoons, I have eaten a cake with fellow students at the Unicafé from time to time. Of course, I can no longer afford such things and similar snacks.</p>

<p>I told him that and it wasn't difficult, because I'm constantly dealing with this issue at the moment. But the situation was still unpleasant for me, because I was lying naked in front of him and he saw and felt me so clearly. I felt so vulnerable and pressured. But it was also exactly what I actually want: a challenge. In the future, I don't want him to have a single critical thought when he looks at me. This will probably be really difficult, but it is a motivation!</p>

<p>I could write even more, because one or the other small triviality I still experienced. But for now it must be enough.</p>

<p>Best regards and see you soon
your Sophie</p>

<p>Hi Sophie, thanks for translating (it is no problem if you write in German either, I just put the text into Google Translate)</p>

<p>So nice of you to freeze and strave youself and even wear painful shoes for your boyfriend, he must love you so much for this:)</p>

<p>I love my GF so much for always freezing around me and that she starve herself to look very slim and goodlooking for me.
 I wish she would do like you and wear high heels more, but she finds it to painfull to wear often, but I hope I can support her enough so she will wear heels more.</p>

<p>Are you going to dress more skimpy and be freezing more even when you are not with your BF? 
Are going to reduce the number of meals you eat a day to maybe just one small meal a day?</p>

<p>Looking forward to hear more from you:)</p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hallo Sophie,</p>

<p>ich will noch antworten, bevor die Woche wieder richtig losstartet.</p>

<p>Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass er mit so einer Reaktion nach der Auszeit nicht gerechnet hat. - Entweder sie meldet ich gar nicht mehr, sie meldet sich und sagt nichts zum Thema, oder sie haelt mir eine Standpauke, dass das aufzuhoeren hat. - Ich denke, hier gingen die Punkte klar an dich.</p>

<p>Auch wenn die Temperaturen bei duenner Kleidung schon noch unangenehm sein koennen in den naechsten Monaten, wird das fuer dich vermutlich zunaechst die kleinere Herausforderung. Dafuer koennte ich mir vorstellen, dass es fuer dich ein recht hungriger Sommer werden wird ;-) Aber ich denke, dass Du Dir sehr bewusst bist, dass Du an dem Abend schon etwas mit dem Feuer gespielt hast.</p>

<p>Als Du ihm klarmachtest, dass du nichts essen willst, obwohl du schon "etwas" Hunger hattest, hat er da nicht gleich nachgefraft, wie viel Du am Tag schon gegessen hattest? Wie "etwas" war es denn wirklich? Hat er Dir am anderen Morgen wenigstens ein Fruehstueck bereitet?</p>

<p>Du schreibst, "In Zukunft soll ihm kein einziger kritischer Gedanke mehr kommen, wenn er mich anschaut. Das wird zwar wahrscheinlich echt schwierig ... " Ich glaube kaum, dass Dir das gelingen wird ... und dass das ueberhaupt wichtig ist. Ich denke, hier ist der Weg das Ziel und wenn man den Weg gut geht, wird er selbstredend auch Erfolge haben. Was genau meine ich damit? Haettest Du ueber Nacht ploetzlich 5 kg weniger auf der Waage, dann wuerde er sich sicherlich auch darueber freuen. Es wuerde aber bei Weitem nicht den Reiz aufwiegen, Dich auf dem Weg dorthin zu begleiten. Ihm wird es gefallen, wie Du Dir Gedanken machst, Dir Plaene machst, darum kaempft, sie auch einzuhalten, will Deine Disziplin, deinen Durchhaltewille beobachten. Ganz nach dem Motto "Erscheinung ueber Komfort" Dazu wuerde dann auch seine Frage passen (wenn Du sie so sauber wiedergegeben hast), <em>wie</em> Du das vorhast und nicht, wieviel Du noch abnehmen willst. Hast Du ueberhaupt schon eine Vorstellung, was ein realistisches Zielgewicht sein koennte?
Dies gesagt, heisst aber auch, dass es kein natuerliches Ende geben wird. Er wird immer wieder irgendwas finden, woran Du noch arbeiten koenntest. Und das solltest Du dann nicht missverstehen, in dem Sinne, dass er unzufrieden ist mit Dir. Ganz im Gegenteil, er will Dich nur mit neuen Herausforderungen locken - und zwar je erfolgreicher, "haerter zu dir" du bist, desto mehr.</p>

<p>Zum Thema, wie Du das schaffst. Wie du schon schreibst, bildet deine aktuelle Ernaehrung ja schon die richtige Grundlage und davon solltest Du auch grundsaetzlich nicht abweichen. </p>

<p>Ich koennte einen ersten, nicht ganz uneigennuetzigen Vorschlag machen ;-) Wenn Du tagsueber schon sehr diszipliniert warst und Angst hast, am Abend schwach zu werden, dann setz Dich an den PC und schreib etwas hier ins Forum. Das wird Dich dann automatisch an Jakob erinnern, dich erinnern, fuer wen Du das machst. Und Du darfst hier dann gerne auch mit Deinem Durchhaltewillen prahlen.</p>

<p>Ansonsten kannst Du nur - auch um des Reizes / des Spieles willen - einige Highlights setzen.</p>

<p>Du fragst irgendwo, ob Lisa nur Schwimmen geht. Ich wuerde behaupten, dass das Schwimmen der ideale Sport hier ist - zumindest faellt mir nichts ein, dass so viele Aspekte abdeckt.</p>

<p>Eine schoene Woche
Ferfred</p>

<p>Hello Frogger, thanks for your answer! Where in scandinavia are you from?</p>

<p>Let's call my cousin Ronja from now on, so that we don't have to call her "my cousin" all the time.</p>

<p>So Ronja usually wears shorts and sneakers up until around -5C. Beyond that she wears jeans and if there's a lot of snow she might put on boots. As I wrote in my previous post, she doesn't wear jackets at all, it seems. 
The tops she wears seem very inconsistent. Sometimes she might wear a short-sleeved crop-top in a snowstorm, other times a hoodie on a warm summer day.
When at our cottage we go to the sauna almost every day. After that she always wears a towel and crocs in winter, and goes barefoot in summer.
I hope that's detailed enough!</p>

<p>As to her eating habits, I have never really paid attention to them. I will meet her in three days, so we will see then. She is rather skinny though.</p>

<p>For me the german posts are no issue. I actually learned a bit of german in school and what I don't understand, I can always translate with google.</p>

<p>Have a nice week!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Hans:)</p>

<p>I am from Norway.
Ronja sounds like a swomen after my taste.
Like how she dresses, I  love women in jeans so my girlfriend, Hanne, wears almost jeans always.</p>

<p>The skinnier a girl is the more cold she feels I believe. Love when you can she girls ribs covered in goosebumps:)</p>

<p>Hope to hear more from you, have a nice week! </p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hi Ferfred,</p>

<p>How are you and Lisa and Markus doing?
She must be a bit glad no the spring a warmer weather is coming so she wont freeze so much:)
I have some questions about her diet:
How much do you think she eats in a day? Do she eat every day? 
And how many cigaretts do she smoke a day?</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you.
Have a nice week.</p>

<p>Best regards, Frogger</p>

<p>Hallo Sophie, 
Dein Freund kann sich glücklich schätzen, du hast sicher eine super Figur, mit 54kg bei 1,73 cm bist du sehr schlank und dein Outfit wird deinem Freund sicher auch gefallen. </p>

<p>Du schreibst:ich will einfach ein bisschen herausstechen und in allem besser/sexier sein als die anderen Mädels um mich herum.</p>

<p>Ich glaube so denkt auch Lisa, sie möchte sich für sich und Marcus von den anderen sexier unterscheiden. Marcus möchte sie schlanker und nur in sexy Klamotten sehen und zeigen, ganz gleich, ob das Wetter es zulässt. Dabei reizt auch Lisa die Aufmerksamkeit und Bewunderung. Und die ist umso größer, je kälter es ist. </p>

<p>Du: Zum einen kann das ja nicht so gesund sein, dauernd zu frieren, und so zu hungern wie Martins Lisa z. B. geht auf Dauer bestimmt auf die eine oder andere Weise schief. Aber das verlangt ja auch niemand von mir!</p>

<p>Ganz sicher ist es nicht gesund, Lisa ist während der kalten Jahreszeit ständig erkältet,  manchmal mit schlimmen Hustenanfaellen, selbst eine Blasenentzündung habe ich schon mal mitbekommen, doch all das hält Lisa nicht davon ab, bei Wind und Wetter ohne wärmende Klamotten unterwegs zu sein. Auch wenn sie unkontrolliert zittert, drängt Lisa nie darauf ins Warme zu kommen oder vielleicht etwas zu essen, wenn sie ihr Hungergefuehl nur noch durch Zigaretten etwas unterdrücken kann. Auf ihre Erkaeltung angesprochen, behauptet sie dann mit klappernden Zähnen: Der Husten kommt vom Rauchen, bin nur leicht erkältet, wird schon wieder besser. </p>

<p>Du schreibst: Aber das verlangt ja auch niemand von mir!
Von Lisa verlangt Marcus auch nichts, doch er stellt Lisa vor immer neue Herausforderungen. Ausserdem macht er immer Komplimente und Andeutungen, dass sie es sich leisten kann Haut zu zeigen  Also sei vorsichtig Sophie, dass du nicht übertreibst, vorallem wenn es um deine Gesundheit geht. Ich habe oft Angst um Lisa, gerade wenn Lisa schon völlig unterkühlt ist und er sie fragt, ob sie noch eine Runde im See schwimmen möchte oder ob sie etwas dagegen hat, wenn sie mit Freunden noch weiter etwas im Freien unternehmen.
Lisa würde niemals beklagen, dass ihr zu kalt ist oder sie unbedingt etwas Essen muss. Sie hat zu große Angst Marcus zu enttäuschen, vielleicht auch, weil sie einige Jahre älter ist und trotzdem attraktiver erscheinen möchte, als die jüngeren Freundinnen von Marcus Kumpels.</p>

<p>Zu deinen weiteren Fragen: 
Sie scheint ja echt auf Dauerdiät zu sein. Isst sie da nicht viel zu wenig, sodass sie auf Dauer total abmagert?</p>

<p>Dauerdiät trifft es schon. Doch als total abgemagert würde ich sie nicht bezeichnen. Auf jeden Fall zeichnen sich ihre Rippen, Schlüsselbeine, Schulterblaetter oder auch ihre Hüftknochen klar ab, dabei hat es Lisa  geschafft ihren Fettanteil noch weiter zu reduzieren und trotzdem Muskeln aufzubauen, deshalb kann sie ihren Erfolg auch nicht auf der Waage sehen und ist der Meinung, dass sie  nicht schlank genug ist.</p>

<p> Es klingt ja gerade so, dass sie quasi nie eine normale Mahlzeit ist. </p>

<p>Stimmt eine normale Mahlzeit habe ich mit ihr noch nie erlebt. </p>

<p>If sie allein ist, isst sie vermutlich ein kleines bisschen mehr, als wenn sie mit Markus irgendwo hingeht oder? </p>

<p>Auch das ist richtig, wenn sie allein ist, dann isst sie so spezielle Eiweißreiche Fertignahrung. Mit Marcus gemeinsam wegzugehen bedeutet für Lisa Zigaretten und vielleicht einen Espresso im Restaurant. </p>

<p>Und sie geht ja immer im See schwimmen. Ist das alles, was sie an Sport macht oder macht sie auch Krafttraining?</p>

<p>Ich wusste nur vom Schwimmen, habe sie aber mal gefragt, ob das für ihre Top Figur reicht, sie strich über ihren Bauchmuskeln und meinte, dass sie dafür extra trainieren muss. </p>

<p>LG Martin </p>

<p>Hallo Ferfred, 
Noch schnell ein paar Antworten zu deinen Fragen.</p>

<p>Ich frage mich manchmal, ob sich Lisa schon damit gefunden hat, keine warme Kleidung oder etwas zu Essen zu bekommen, wenn sie mit Marcus unterwegs ist. </p>

<p>Diese Frage stelle ich mir auch, aber ich denke: ja, sie hat sich nicht nur damit abgefunden, sondern möchte auch zeigen, dass sie hart genug zu sich selbst ist, für Marcus zu hungern, unentwegt zu trainieren und ihre Traumfigur höchstens mit Gänsehaut zu bedecken. </p>

<p>ZB als ihr nach ihrem Schwimmtraining in den Garten gegangen seid und Marcus sich passende Kleidung herausgesucht hat. Hatte sie darauf gehofft, auch etwas warmes mitgebracht zu bekommen? </p>

<p>Hier denke ich, dass sie es zumindest gehofft hat, da sie wirklich völlig durchgefroren war, teilweise unkontrolliert zitterte und Marcus das auch kommentierte: Lisa findest du nicht auch, dass es wieder kühler ist, als die letzten Tage? Lisa antwortete mit blauen Lippen und klappernden Zähnen: Ja, finde ich auch, echt noch mal kalt heute. Marcus: Mir ist es zu kalt in meiner Jacke, ich muss mir erstmal etwas Wärmeres anziehen.</p>

<p>Oder als er ihr Flip-Flops oder später einen Mantel angeboten hat: Wollte er Lisa nur herausfordern oder war es fürsorglich gemeint? </p>

<p>Sowohl als auch, ihm war sicher klar, dass es barfuß und mit so viel nackter Haut zu kalt war und Lisa an ihre Grenzen kommt, doch mit der Art und Weise, wie er Lisa die Sachen anbietet, zeigt er, dass er enttäuscht wäre, wenn Lisa sie annehmen würde. Andererseits gibt er Lisa die Möglichkeit auszusteigen. </p>

<p>Oder geniesst es Lisa vielleicht sogar, noch mal eins oben drauf zu legen, wenn alle anderen eigentlich schon der Meinung sind, dass sie schon extrem tapfer war?</p>

<p>Auf jeden Fall, geniesst sie es, sich so zu zeigen, wie Marcus es sich vorstellt, vielleicht auch ihre Grenzen zu finden, in der Gewissheit, dass sie zumindest von den Männern dafür bewundert wird und vielleicht von Marcus belohnt. </p>

<p>Gehe ich recht in der Annahme, dass sie bei beiden berichteten Erlebnissen (Garten, Party) solange du warst, keinen Bissen zu essen bekommen hat ... und wahrscheinlich den ganzen Tag noch nichts?</p>

<p>Was sie vorher gegessen hat kann ich nicht sagen, doch als wir auf der Party das Buffet angeschaut haben, meinte Lisa nur, dass sie sich schon den ganzen Tag darauf gefreut habe und großen Hunger hat. Marcus: Denke an deine Figur. Ich reichte ihr einen Teller, doch  Lisa zündete sich die naechste Zigarette an: Nein, danke, mir reicht auch mal die hier. Danach habe ich Lisa fast ununterbrochen rauchen sehen, aber nichts essen. </p>

<p>Das Partyoutfit war ja richtig scharf. Seid wann steht Marcus auf HighHeels? </p>

<p>Zu besonderen Anlässen trägt Lisa auch High Heels.</p>

<p>Waren sie eher gemässigt oder er 10cm-Versionen? </p>

<p>Waren ziemlich hoch. </p>

<p>Ich stelle mir das extrem anstrengend vor, auf solchen Schuhen zu laufen, wenn einem die Beine auch noch schlottern.</p>

<p>Ja, es war extrem anstrengend für Lisa. Sie hatte schon Schwierigkeiten darin zu stehen, ihre zitternden Beinmuskeln waren super zu sehen, durch die Körperspannung natürlich auch alle anderen Muskeln. Beim Laufen konnte man beobachten, dass sie sich voll konzentrieren musste. Auf der Terrasse setzte sie sich später immer mal auf einen Tisch, so konnte sie ihre High Heels tragen, ohne darauf stehen zu müssen. Die Herren konnten ihre Blicke dabei nicht von Lisas braungebrannten, muskulösen, schlanken gänsehautbedeckten  Beinen lassen. Am späten Abend konnte Lisa ihr schlotternden Beine nicht mehr kontrollieren, hat die High Heels dann ausgezogen, lief nun barfuß auf dem kalten Boden.  </p>

<p> Wie hoch war der Rock denn geschlitzt ;-)</p>

<p>Es war ein superkurzer enger Minirock, der auf einer Seite einen Schlitz bis zum Bund hat, dadurch ist der Oberschenkel fast komplett zu sehen.</p>

<p>LG Martin </p>
